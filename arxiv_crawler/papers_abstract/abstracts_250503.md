**Abstract**: Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost
every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I
give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal
problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the
explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this
problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.


### Physical Limits and Optimal Synthesis of Beyond Diagonal Anomalous Scatterers

**Abstract**: Realizing metasurfaces for anomalous scattering is fundamental to designing
reflector arrays, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and metasurface
antennas. However, the basic cost of steering scattering into non-specular
directions is not fully understood. This paper derives tight physical bounds on
anomalous scattering using antenna array systems equipped with non-local
matching networks. The matching networks are explicitly synthesized based on
the solutions of the optimization problems that define these bounds.
Furthermore, we analyze fundamental limits for metasurface antennas implemented
with metallic and dielectric materials exhibiting minimal loss within a finite
design region. The results reveal a typical 6dB reduction in bistatic radar
cross section (RCS) in anomalous directions compared to the forward direction.
Numerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the inherent cost of
achieving anomalous scattering relative to forward or specular scattering for
canonical configurations.

**Abstract**: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths
connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the
complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches
use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their
ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as
high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we
address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from
stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained
generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under
these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to
minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to
repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in
contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We
demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse,
physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the
pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily
incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as
models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

**Authors**: Michael Kapteyn, Anirban Chaudhuri, Ernesto A. B. F. Lima, Graham Pash, Rafael Bravo, Karen Willcox, Thomas E. Yankeelov, David A. Hormuth II

**Published Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2505.00670v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00670v1)

**Abstract**: Background: Advances in the theory and methods of computational oncology have
enabled accurate characterization and prediction of tumor growth and treatment
response on a patient-specific basis. This capability can be integrated into a
digital twin framework in which bi-directional data-flow between the physical
tumor and the digital tumor facilitate dynamic model re-calibration,
uncertainty quantification, and clinical decision-support via recommendation of
optimal therapeutic interventions. However, many digital twin frameworks rely
on bespoke implementations tailored to each disease site, modeling choice, and
algorithmic implementation.
  Findings: We present TumorTwin, a modular software framework for
initializing, updating, and leveraging patient-specific cancer tumor digital
twins. TumorTwin is publicly available as a Python package, with associated
documentation, datasets, and tutorials. Novel contributions include the
development of a patient-data structure adaptable to different disease sites, a
modular architecture to enable the composition of different data, model,
solver, and optimization objects, and CPU- or GPU-parallelized implementations
of forward model solves and gradient computations. We demonstrate the
functionality of TumorTwin via an in silico dataset of high-grade glioma growth
and response to radiation therapy.
  Conclusions: The TumorTwin framework enables rapid prototyping and testing of
image-guided oncology digital twins. This allows researchers to systematically
investigate different models, algorithms, disease sites, or treatment decisions
while leveraging robust numerical and computational infrastructure.

**PDF Url**: [2505.00655v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00655v1)

**Abstract**: Polaritons travelling along a hyperbolic medium's surface have recently
sparked significant interest in nanophotonics for the unprecedented
manipulation ability on light at the nanoscale in a planar way, promising
potential nano-optical applications, especially in two-dimensional circuitry.
Despite of being named hyperbolic polaritons, the hyperbolic nature has not
been thoroughly revealed since an analytical description of the Iso-frequency
contour is still elusive. In this work, we proposed an analytical form for
describing the iso-frequency contour of the hyperbolic polaritons, showcasing
their strictly hyperbolic nature. Such an analytical form is obtained based on
the focusing behavior of the hyperbolic polaritons and verified by both the
published data from commonly used hyperbolic media systems of the hyperbolic
polaritons and our own experimental characterizations on a hyperbolic
metamaterial film. By presenting a concise and intuitive physical image, this
work may provide a groundbreaking methodology in developing novel hyperbolic
polaritons based optical devices.


### Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI
**Authors**: Merve Gülle, Sebastian Weingärtner, Mehmet Akçakaya

**Published Date**: 2025-05-01

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2505.00643v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00643v1)

**Abstract**: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.


### The heat flow conjecture for polynomials and random matrices
**Authors**: Brian C. Hall, Ching-Wei Ho

**Published Date**: 2022-02-19

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2202.09660v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09660v4)

**Abstract**: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the
polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general
conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose
(1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve
according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting
root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial
distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold
for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a
random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem
for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix
models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is
supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect
to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE
perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE\ satisfied by the log
potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally
converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a
"multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the
holomorphic moments.


### SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction
**Authors**: Liu Junchi, Tang Ying, Tretiak Sergei, Duan Wenhui, Zhou Liujiang

**PDF Url**: [2505.00625v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00625v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.


### ParkDiffusion: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction for Automated Parking using Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jiarong Wei, Niclas Vödisch, Anna Rehr, Christian Feist, Abhinav Valada

**Published Date**: 2025-05-01

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2505.00586v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00586v1)

**Abstract**: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.


### A continuum thermodynamic model of the influence of non-ionic surfactant on mass transfer from gas bubbles
**Authors**: Dieter Bothe, Akio Tomiyama

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2505.00581v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00581v1)

**Abstract**: Mass transfer of gaseous components from rising bubbles to the ambient liquid
depends not only on the chemical potential difference of the transfer component
but also on the interfacial free energy and composition. The latter is strongly
affected by surface active agents that are present in many applications.
Surfactants lead to local changes in the interfacial tension, which influence
the mass transfer rates in two different ways. On the one hand, inhomogeneous
interfacial tension leads to Marangoni stress, which can strongly change the
local hydrodynamics. One the other hand, the coverage by surfactant molecules
results in a mass transfer resistance. This hindrance effect is not included in
current continuum physical models. The present work provides the experimental
validation of a recently introduced extended sharp-interface model for
two-phase flows with mass transfer that also accounts for the mass transfer
hindrance due to adsorbed surfactant. The crucial feature is to account for
area-specific concentrations not only of adsorbed constituents but also of
transfer species, and to model mass transfer as a series of two bi-directional
sorption-type bulk-interface exchange processes. The resulting model is shown
to quantitatively describe experimental measurements on mass transfer reduction
for the dissolution of CO$_2$ bubbles in different surfactant solutions.


## Diffusion
### Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models
**Authors**: Hansheng Chen, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Zexiang Xu, Fujun Luan, Leonidas Guibas, Gordon Wetzstein, Sai Bi

**Published Date**: 2025-04-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2504.05304v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05304v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and
predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean
as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to
discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under
classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the
mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a
multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL
divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and
flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising
loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic
denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates
the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow
matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with
only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.


### Generative Predictive Control: Flow Matching Policies for Dynamic and Difficult-to-Demonstrate Tasks
**Authors**: Vince Kurtz, Joel W. Burdick

**Published Date**: 2025-02-19

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-01

**PDF Url**: [2502.13406v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13406v2)

**Abstract**: Generative control policies have recently unlocked major progress in
robotics. These methods produce action sequences via diffusion or flow
matching, with training data provided by demonstrations. But existing methods
come with two key limitations: they require expert demonstrations, which can be
difficult to obtain, and they are limited to relatively slow, quasi-static
tasks. In this paper, we leverage a tight connection between sampling-based
predictive control and generative modeling to address each of these issues. In
particular, we introduce generative predictive control, a supervised learning
framework for tasks with fast dynamics that are easy to simulate but difficult
to demonstrate. We then show how trained flow-matching policies can be
warm-started at inference time, maintaining temporal consistency and enabling
high-frequency feedback. We believe that generative predictive control offers a
complementary approach to existing behavior cloning methods, and hope that it
paves the way toward generalist policies that extend beyond quasi-static
demonstration-oriented tasks.


### Conditional Diffusion-Based Retrieval of Atmospheric CO2 from Earth Observing Spectroscopy

**Abstract**: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.
