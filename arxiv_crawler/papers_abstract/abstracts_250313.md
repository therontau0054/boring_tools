**Abstract**: Symbolic regression is essential for deriving interpretable expressions that
elucidate complex phenomena by exposing the underlying mathematical and
physical relationships in data. In this paper, we present an advanced symbolic
regression method that integrates symbol priors from diverse scientific domains
- including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering - into the regression
process. By systematically analyzing domain-specific expressions, we derive
probability distributions of symbols to guide expression generation. We propose
novel tree-structured recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverage these
symbol priors, enabling domain knowledge to steer the learning process.
Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical tree structure for representing
expressions, where unary and binary operators are organized to facilitate more
efficient learning. To further accelerate training, we compile characteristic
expression blocks from each domain and include them in the operator dictionary,
providing relevant building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that
leveraging symbol priors significantly enhances the performance of symbolic
regression, resulting in faster convergence and higher accuracy.

**Abstract**: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of
the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon
spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to
$\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass
and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$
mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$
and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point
$x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the
Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of
$\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and
$c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary
alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$,
the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for
physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and
$\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation
$\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods,
resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time
cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from
distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications
to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are
capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a
declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus
avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing
Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that
bypassed dark energy [A&A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension
without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.

**Abstract**: Light-based detectors have been widely used in fundamental research and
industry since their inception in the 1930s. The energy particles deposit in
these detectors is converted to optical signals via the Cherenkov and
scintillation mechanisms that are then propagated through transparent media to
photosensors placed typically on the detector's periphery, sometimes up to tens
of metres away. LiquidO is a new technique pioneering the use of opaque media
to stochastically confine light around each energy deposition while collecting
it with an array of fibres that thread the medium. This approach preserves
topological event information otherwise lost in the conventional approach,
enabling real-time imaging down to the MeV scale. Our article demonstrates
LiquidO's imaging principle with a ten-litre prototype, revealing successful
light confinement of 90% of the detected light within a 5 cm radius sphere,
using a custom opaque scintillator with a scattering length on the order of a
few millimetres. These high-resolution imaging capabilities unlock
opportunities in fundamental physics research and applications beyond. The
absolute amount of light detected is also studied, including possible
data-driven extrapolations to LiquidO-based detectors beyond prototyping
limitations. Additionally, LiquidO's timing capabilities are explored through
its ability to distinguish Cherenkov light from a slow scintillator.

**Abstract**: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can
significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This
``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation
of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while
ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the
appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the
wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative
separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid
approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and
breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the
unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics
on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent
violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation
occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale)
compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for
correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range
physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are
coupled by the long-range potential.

**PDF Url**: [2503.09571v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09571v1)

**Abstract**: We study stratifications of regions in the space of symmetric matrices. Their
points are Mandelstam matrices for momentum vectors in particle physics.
Kinematic strata in these regions are indexed by signs and rank two matroids.
Matroid strata of Lorentzian quadratic forms arise when all signs are
non-negative. We characterize the posets of strata, for massless and massive
particles, with and without momentum conservation.

**Abstract**: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches
using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed
techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving
ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front
generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the
longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a
uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations
of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC
charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad).
Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is
efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of
less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$
nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the
Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to
the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results
establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider
applications making a significant step towards the realization of
high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.

**Abstract**: Utilizing an emergent metric developed from deep learning techniques, we
determine the complex potential associated with static quarkonium. This study
explores the disintegration process of quarkonium by analyzing the real
component of this potential, which is crucial for understanding its stability
in various conditions. We show that the dissociation length, the critical
distance at which a quark and antiquark pair disintegrate, decreases as the
temperature increases. Furthermore, our assessment of the imaginary component
of the potential indicates an increase in the magnitude of the imaginary
potential for quarkonium as temperatures rise. This enhancement contributes to
the quarkonium's suppression within the quark-gluon plasma, mirroring the
anticipated outcomes from QCD. Our findings not only confirm the theoretical
predictions but also demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning methods in
advancing our understanding of high-energy particle physics.

**Abstract**: Calculating the effects of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) is one of the
most computationally expensive tasks in accelerator physics. Here, we use
convolutional neural networks (CNN's), along with a latent conditional
diffusion (LCD) model, trained on physics-based simulations to speed up
calculations. Specifically, we produce the 3D CSR wakefields generated by
electron bunches in circular orbit in the steady-state condition. Two datasets
are used for training and testing the models: wakefields generated by
three-dimensional Gaussian electron distributions and wakefields from a sum of
up to 25 three-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The CNN's are able to
accurately produce the 3D wakefields $\sim 250-1000$ times faster than the
numerical calculations, while the LCD has a gain of a factor of $\sim 34$. We
also test the extrapolation and out-of-distribution generalization ability of
the models. They generalize well on distributions with larger spreads than what
they were trained on, but struggle with smaller spreads.


### Grounding Video Models to Actions through Goal Conditioned Exploration
**Authors**: Yunhao Luo, Yilun Du

**Published Date**: 2024-11-11

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-12

**PDF Url**: [2411.07223v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07223v2)

**Abstract**: Large video models, pretrained on massive amounts of Internet video, provide
a rich source of physical knowledge about the dynamics and motions of objects
and tasks. However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an
agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states
depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate
vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map
image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often
expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar
to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to
directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in
the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for
exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action
generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve
complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels,
or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero,
6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual
Navigation. We show how our approach is on par with or even surpasses multiple
behavior cloning baselines trained on expert demonstrations while without
requiring any action annotations.


### Quantum position verification in one shot: parallel repetition of the $f$-BB84 and $f$-routing protocols
**Authors**: Llorenç Escolà-Farràs, Florian Speelman

**Abstract**: Quantum position verification (QPV) aims to verify an untrusted prover's
location by timing communication with them. To reduce uncertainty, it is
desirable for this verification to occur in a single round. However, previous
protocols achieving one-round secure QPV had critical drawbacks: attackers
pre-sharing an EPR pair per qubit could perfectly break them, and their
security depended on quantum information traveling at the speed of light in
vacuum, a major experimental challenge in quantum networks. In this work, we
prove that a single round of interaction suffices for secure position
verification while overcoming these limitations. We show that security for a
one-round protocol can rely only on the size of the classical information
rather than quantum resources, making implementation more feasible, even with a
qubit error tolerance of up to 3.6%, which is experimentally achievable with
current technology -- and showing that the timing constraints have to apply
only to classical communication. In short, we establish parallel repetition of
the $f$-BB84 and $f$-routing QPV protocols. As a consequence of our techniques,
we also demonstrate an order-of-magnitude improvement in the error tolerance
for the sequential repetition version of these protocols, compared to the
previous bounds of Nature Physics 18, 623-626 (2022).


## Diffusion
### Minimax Optimality of the Probability Flow ODE for Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Score-based diffusion models have become a foundational paradigm for modern
generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in generating samples
from complex high-dimensional distributions. Despite the dominant adoption of
probability flow ODE-based samplers in practice due to their superior sampling
efficiency and precision, rigorous statistical guarantees for these methods
have remained elusive in the literature. This work develops the first
end-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that
establishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target
data distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with
$\beta$-H\"older smooth densities for $\beta\leq 2$, we propose a smooth
regularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score
error and the associated mean Jacobian error. Leveraging this estimator within
a refined convergence analysis of the ODE-based sampling process, we
demonstrate that the resulting sampler achieves the minimax rate in total
variation distance, modulo logarithmic factors. Notably, our theory
comprehensively accounts for all sources of error in the sampling process and
does not require strong structural conditions such as density lower bounds or
Lipschitz/smooth scores on target distributions, thereby covering a broad range
of practical data distributions.


### Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models

**Abstract**: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models
due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet
they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In
this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that
interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models.
Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting
flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching
and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block
diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of
gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance.
Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models
on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length
sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on
the project page: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/


### DAWN-FM: Data-Aware and Noise-Informed Flow Matching for Solving Inverse Problems
**Authors**: Shadab Ahamed, Eldad Haber

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.04766v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04766v2)

**Abstract**: Inverse problems, which involve estimating parameters from incomplete or
noisy observations, arise in various fields such as medical imaging,
geophysics, and signal processing. These problems are often ill-posed,
requiring regularization techniques to stabilize the solution. In this work, we
employ Flow Matching (FM), a generative framework that integrates a
deterministic processes to map a simple reference distribution, such as a
Gaussian, to the target distribution. Our method DAWN-FM: Data-AWare and
Noise-informed Flow Matching incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing
the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also
account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in
scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent
velocity field, FM not only provides accurate solutions but also enables
uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike
pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings,
our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to
varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our
method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image
deblurring and tomography.


### The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging

**Abstract**: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and
scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space
acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN
architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency
layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can
become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number
of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that
alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a
data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly
iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability
challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable
ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy.
R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively
estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data
residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the
Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially
trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D
multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled
radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs
achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net
(whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art
diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by
a slower reconstruction process).


### Sparse Autoencoder as a Zero-Shot Classifier for Concept Erasing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in
generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about
generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been
proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch,
they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this
work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable
precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall
performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each
concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the
specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a
zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target
concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we
demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without
requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity
identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's
effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal
concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial
prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at:
