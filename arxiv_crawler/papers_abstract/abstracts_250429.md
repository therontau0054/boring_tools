**Abstract**: Dark Matter (DM) is a known unknown. Apart, current experimental constraints
on flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes involving up-type quarks
also provide scope to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this
article, we establish a connection between the flavor sector and the DM sector
with minimal extension of the SM. Here a singlet complex scalar field, stable
under $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, acts as DM and couples to SM up-type quarks
through a heavy Dirac vector-like quark (VLQ), which shares the same
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ charge as of the DM. The model thus addresses the observed
$D^0-\bar{D^0}$ mixing, top-FCNC interactions, and $D^0$ meson decays, together
with DM relic density, while evading the direct and indirect DM search bounds.
The model can be probed at the future high-energy muon collider, through
distinctive signatures of VLQ production, where the VLQ decays into DM and SM
particles, abiding by the existing bounds.

**PDF Url**: [2504.20019v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20019v1)

**Abstract**: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws with
data-driven models to improve generalization and sample efficiency. This work
introduces an open-source implementation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network
with Control (PINC) framework, designed to model the dynamics of an underwater
vehicle. Using initial states, control actions, and time inputs, PINC extends
PINNs to enable physically consistent transitions beyond the training domain.
Various PINC configurations are tested, including differing loss functions,
gradient-weighting schemes, and hyperparameters. Validation on a simulated
underwater vehicle demonstrates more accurate long-horizon predictions compared
to a non-physics-informed baseline

**PDF Url**: [2502.16029v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16029v2)

**Abstract**: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can
be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable
(qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic
power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary
time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear
combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's
infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful
compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without
discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on
the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For
completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both
near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles
in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our
algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we
provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order
effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.


### Uncovering the Maximum Chirality in Dielectric Nanostructures

**Abstract**: Maximum structural chirality refers to the highest selectivity for circularly
polarized light (CPL) in nanostructures, often manifested as maximum circular
dichroism (CD), optical rotation (OR), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However,
the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain
unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric
nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of
multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole
decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that
allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions
required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive
framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future
investigations of chiral nanostructures.

**Abstract**: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By
constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing
momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more
particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly
interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the
few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite
families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only
flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative
number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is
constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a
generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The
second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi
that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the
familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which
some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.


### Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective
**Authors**: Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang

**PDF Url**: [2502.03442v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03442v2)

**Abstract**: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena
in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes
of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially
localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of
spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional
symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$
(parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions
compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch
bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to
constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show
that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the
symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is
non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier
functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological
fragility.


### On the mechanics of inhaled bronchial transmission of pathogenic microdroplets generated from the upper respiratory tract, with implications for infection onset

**Abstract**: Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic stretching and break-up of
mucosal liquids in the upper respiratory tract (URT), when inhaled further
downwind, explain the brisk pace at which deep lung infections emerge following
onset of initial infection at the URT? While it is well-established that
particulates inhaled from outside can possibly penetrate to the lower airway
only if they are < 5 microns, the fate of particulates (many > 5-microns in
diameter) sheared away from the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains an
open question. These particulates predominantly originate at the nasopharynx,
oropharynx, and laryngeal chamber with the vocal folds. To resolve the posed
question, this study considers a CT-based 3D anatomical airway reconstruction
and isolates the tract from the laryngeal vocal fold region, mapping the entire
tracheal cavity and concluding at generation 2 of the tracheobronchial tree.
Through the delineated geometry, airflow simulation is conducted using the LES
scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min. Against the ambient air
flux, numerical experiments have been performed to monitor the transport of
liquid particulates with diameters 1-30 microns, bearing physical properties
akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical
transmission trends to the lower airway were found consistent with the findings
from a reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualized the impact of
intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point
vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided 2D potential flow domain. The results
collectively demonstrate markedly elevated trends of deep lung penetration by
the URT-derived particulates, even if they are as large as 10- and 15 microns.
The high viral load carried by such droplets to the bronchial spaces could
mechanistically explain the accelerated seeding of infection in the lungs.

**Abstract**: Learning well-separated features in high-dimensional spaces, such as text or
image embeddings, is crucial for many machine learning applications. Achieving
such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of
embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By
constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to
well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are
known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we
typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and
moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented
training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions
inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to
encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise
distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from
disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities.
Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise
dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose
an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an
effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally,
we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the
hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image
classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms
exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.


### A CMOS Probabilistic Computing Chip With In-situ hardware Aware Learning
**Authors**: Jinesh Jhonsa, William Whitehead, David McCarthy, Shuvro Chowdhury, Kerem Camsari, Luke Theogarajan

**Published Date**: 2025-04-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-28

**PDF Url**: [2504.14070v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14070v2)

**Abstract**: This paper demonstrates a probabilistic bit physics inspired solver with 440
spins configured in a Chimera graph, occupying an area of 0.44 mm^2. Area
efficiency is maximized through a current-mode implementation of the neuron
update circuit, standard cell design for analog blocks pitch-matched to digital
blocks, and a shared power supply for both digital and analog components.
Process variation related mismatches introduced by this approach are
effectively mitigated using a hardware aware contrastive divergence algorithm
during training. We validate the chip's ability to perform probabilistic
computing tasks such as modeling logic gates and full adders, as well as
optimization tasks such as MaxCut, demonstrating its potential for AI and
machine learning applications.


### Index and localization for type B superconformal mechanics on singular spaces
**Authors**: Joris Raeymaekers, Paolo Rossi, Canberk Sanli

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-28

**PDF Url**: [2412.04390v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04390v3)

**Abstract**: Type B superconformal quantum mechanical sigma models are of physical
interest as they arise in the description of D-brane bound states forming an
AdS$_2$ throat. In this work we discuss the applicability of localization
methods to compute the superconformal index in these theories, despite the fact
that their target spaces are generically singular. Similar in spirit to recent
works on type A models, we propose to work on a suitably resolved target space
to compute a regularized index. While this regularized index correctly captures
the actual index unambiguously in models of physical interest, we do uncover a
subtlety in more pathological examples. This occurs in situations where the
supercharge is not essentially-selfadjoint, in which case the index becomes
ambiguous and depends on the chosen selfadjoint extension. We also discuss the
special class of models with K\"ahler target spaces, which can accommodate both
type A and type B models, and show that the type B index is a particular limit
of the type A index. For Calabi-Yau cones, the type B index coincides with the
Hilbert series of the unresolved space.


## Diffusion
### OmniEdit: Building Image Editing Generalist Models Through Specialist Supervision

**Abstract**: Instruction-guided image editing methods have demonstrated significant
potential by training diffusion models on automatically synthesized or manually
annotated image editing pairs. However, these methods remain far from
practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges
contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills
due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with
datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the
application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these
datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio,
limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we
present \omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different
image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in
four folds: (1) \omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven
different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance
sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o)
instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing
architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we
provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle
any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of
different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different
tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that
\omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models. Our code,
dataset and model will be available at https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/OmniEdit/


### Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation
**Authors**: Bingye Zhou, Caiyang Yu

**Published Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.17827v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17827v2)

**Abstract**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its
transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and
complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs.
Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a
generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures
for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion
models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by
high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose
Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel
approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation.
EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in
diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian
distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the
strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and
effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with
an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need
for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50
times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.


### A Basic Evaluation of Neural Networks Trained with the Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm

**Abstract**: Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various
tasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training
method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has
inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such
alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a
biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses
throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers,
thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study
presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its
effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks.
Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve
high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and
convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron
count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations
formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature
extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that
EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks
and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired
neural networks.


### Diffusion Stochastic Learning Over Adaptive Competing Networks
**Authors**: Yike Zhao, Haoyuan Cai, Ali H. Sayed

**Published Date**: 2025-04-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-28

**PDF Url**: [2504.19635v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19635v1)

**Abstract**: This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams,
each consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative
settings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game
aims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their
objectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the
competition, agents share strategic information within their own team while
simultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team.
We propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of
this network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph
interactions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team
subgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed
algorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results
through experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.


### AI Alignment in Medical Imaging: Unveiling Hidden Biases Through Counterfactual Analysis

**PDF Url**: [2504.19621v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19621v1)

**Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated
remarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses
significant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization
performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to
evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes,
such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual
invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain
unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a
practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with
statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without
requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on
synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets,
including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach
aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard
baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic
systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical
step towards AI safety in healthcare. Code:
