**Abstract**: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are
central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as
one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses
from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra,
supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse
compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to
control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been
limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise.
Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-trained convolutional neural
network (P-CNN) can circumvent such challenges, showing few-fold speedups over
the direct approaches. We highlight three key advancements enabled by the P-CNN
approach: (i) on-demand control over spectral features of SC, (ii) direct
generation of sub-3-cycle pulses from the highly nonlinear fiber, and (iii) the
production of high-order solitons, capturing distinct "breather" dynamics in
both spectral and temporal domains. This approach heralds a new era of
arbitrary spectro-temporal state engineering, with transformative implications
for ultrafast and quantum science.


### Multiple Landau level filling for a mean field limit of 2D fermions
**Authors**: Denis Périce

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2212.03780v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03780v2)

**Abstract**: Motivated by the quantum hall effect, we study N two dimensional interacting
fermions in a large magnetic field limit. We work in a bounded domain, ensuring
finite degeneracy of the Landau levels. In our regime, several levels are fully
filled and inert: the density in these levels is constant. We derive a limiting
mean-field and semi classical description of the physics in the last, partially
filled Landau level.

**Abstract**: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal
properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by
thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches,
the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact
results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of
the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles,
taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in
one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic
arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in
particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these
principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of
thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the
structure of hydrodynamic modes. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable
models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model
for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in
fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while
long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and
non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is
expected to give all cumulants.


### Resolving Multiple-Dynamic Model Uncertainty in Hypothesis-Driven Belief-MDPs
**Authors**: Ofer Dagan, Tyler Becker, Zachary N. Sunberg

**Published Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2411.14404v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14404v1)

**Abstract**: When human operators of cyber-physical systems encounter surprising behavior,
they often consider multiple hypotheses that might explain it. In some cases,
taking information-gathering actions such as additional measurements or control
inputs given to the system can help resolve uncertainty and determine the most
accurate hypothesis. The task of optimizing these actions can be formulated as
a belief-space Markov decision process that we call a hypothesis-driven belief
MDP. Unfortunately, this problem suffers from the curse of history similar to a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To plan in continuous
domains, an agent needs to reason over countlessly many possible
action-observation histories, each resulting in a different belief over the
unknown state. The problem is exacerbated in the hypothesis-driven context
because each action-observation pair spawns a different belief for each
hypothesis, leading to additional branching. This paper considers the case in
which each hypothesis corresponds to a different dynamic model in an underlying
POMDP. We present a new belief MDP formulation that: (i) enables reasoning over
multiple hypotheses, (ii) balances the goals of determining the (most likely)
correct hypothesis and performing well in the underlying POMDP, and (iii) can
be solved with sparse tree search.


### High-distance codes with transversal Clifford and T-gates
**Authors**: Shubham P. Jain, Victor V. Albert

**Published Date**: 2024-08-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2408.12752v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12752v2)

**Abstract**: The non-local interactions in several quantum devices allow for the
realization of more compact quantum encodings while retaining the same degree
of protection against noise. Anticipating that short to medium-length codes
will soon be realizable, it is important to construct stabilizer codes that,
for a given code distance, admit fault-tolerant implementations of logical
gates with the fewest number of physical qubits. We extract high-distance
doubly even codes from the quantum quadratic-residue code family that admit a
transversal implementation of the single-qubit Clifford group and block
transversal implementation of the full Clifford group. Applying a doubling
procedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields a family of high-distance
weak triply even codes which admit a transversal implementation of the logical
$\texttt{T}$-gate. Relaxing the triply even property, we also obtain a family
of triorthogonal codes which requires an even lower overhead at the cost of
additional Clifford gates to achieve the same logical operation. To our
knowledge, our doubly even and triorthogonal families are the shortest qubit
stabilizer codes of the same distance that can realize their respective gates.


### Integrating Physics of the Problem into Data-Driven Methods to Enhance Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion with Uncertainty Quantification
**Authors**: Vahid Negahdari, Seyed Reza Moghadasi, Mohammad Reza Razvan

**Published Date**: 2024-06-04

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2406.05153v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05153v2)

**Abstract**: Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear iterative seismic imaging
technique that, by reducing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic
waveforms, can produce detailed estimates of subsurface geophysical properties.
Nevertheless, the strong nonlinearity of FWI can trap the optimization in local
minima. This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the
absence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related
considerations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced
machine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have
attracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community.
Furthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent
elastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and
elastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this
paper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (physics of the problem)
and integrating it with machine learning techniques, we propose methods for the
solution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven
and physics-based approaches. Moreover, to address uncertainty quantification,
by modifying the structure of the Variational Autoencoder, we introduce a
probabilistic deep learning method based on the physics of the problem that
enables us to explore the uncertainties of the solution. According to the
limited availability of datasets in this field and to assess the performance
and accuracy of the proposed methods, we create a comprehensive dataset close
to reality and conduct a comparative analysis of the presented approaches to
it.


### Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state
**Authors**: Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin

**Published Date**: 2024-05-01

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2405.00663v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00663v3)

**Abstract**: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in
general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum
information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES
generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states
can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated
genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys
to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message
encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way
SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like
intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental
realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of
freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols
have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to
simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases
the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This
capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication
systems.

**Authors**: Daniel Ake, Antonio O. Bouzas, F. Larios

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2311.09488v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09488v2)

**Abstract**: There is growing interest in the development of a muon collider that would
make it possible to produce lepton collisions at energies of several TeV. Among
others, there can be significant contributions to electroweak gauge boson,
Higgs boson and top quark physics. In this work we pay attention to the latter,
in particular, effective flavor-changing (FC) top-quark interactions. We
discuss the flavor changing $t \bar q$ ($q=u,c$) production processes that can
be a good probe of the dimension-six top quark four-fermion and fermion-boson
operators in the SMEFT. We consider all sixteen operators that can generate
flavor-changing top quark couplings. After comparing with the current LHC
bounds, we find potential limits three or four orders of magnitude stronger for
four-fermion operators. Concerning fermion-boson couplings, for the tensor
operators $Q_{uW}$ and $Q_{uB}$ we obtain the highest sensitivity. We also
observe that the effective $W$ approximation (EWA) does not apply with
$Q_{uB}$.


### Aspects of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T }$ deformed Schwarzian: From gravity partition function to late-time spectral form factor
**Authors**: Arpan Bhattacharyya, Saptaswa Ghosh, Sounak Pal

**Published Date**: 2023-09-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2309.16658v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16658v4)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we investigate different thermodynamic properties of
$T\bar{T}+J\bar{T}$ deformed Schwarzian theory and its different gravitational
perspectives. First, we compute the partition function of $U(1)$ coupled
2D-gravity with fixed chemical potential, obtained from the dimensional
reduction of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. Then, we compute the
partition function of the gravity theory which is the dual to the deformed
Schwarzian living on its boundary and study the genus expansion of the one and
two-point correlation function of the partition function of the theory.
Subsequently, we use the one-point function to compute the "Annealed" and
"Quenched" free energy in low-temperature limits and make a qualitative
comparison with the undeformed theory. Then, using the two-point function, we
compute the Spectral Form Factor of the deformed theory in early and late time.
We find a dip and ramp structure in early and late time, respectively. We also
get a plateau structure in the $\tau$-scaling limit. Last but not least, we
comment on the late-time topology change to give a physical interpretation of
the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor for our theory.


### Platinum Black for stray-light mitigation on high-aspect-ratio micromechanical cantilever

**PDF Url**: [2411.14324v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14324v1)

**Abstract**: Microscopic devices are widely used in optomechanical experiments at the
cutting-edge of precision experimental physics. Such devices often need to have
high electrical conductivity but low reflectivity at optical wavelengths, which
can be competing requirements for many commonly available coatings. In this
manuscript, we present a technique to electroplate platinum with a highly
convoluted surface on a $475\,\mathrm{\mu m } \, \times 500\,\mathrm{\mu m } \,
\times 10\,\mathrm{\mu m }$ Silicon/Gold cantilever, preserving its electrical
conductivity but reducing its reflectivity in the $0.3 - 1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$
range by a factor of $100$ or greater. The fact that the deposition can be done
post-fabrication without damaging delicate structures makes this technique of
interest to a potentially large range of experimental applications.


## Diffusion
### Stable Flow: Vital Layers for Training-Free Image Editing
**Authors**: Omri Avrahami, Or Patashnik, Ohad Fried, Egor Nemchinov, Kfir Aberman, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of content synthesis and
editing. Recent models have replaced the traditional UNet architecture with the
Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and employed flow-matching for improved training
and sampling. However, they exhibit limited generation diversity. In this work,
we leverage this limitation to perform consistent image edits via selective
injection of attention features. The main challenge is that, unlike the
UNet-based models, DiT lacks a coarse-to-fine synthesis structure, making it
unclear in which layers to perform the injection. Therefore, we propose an
automatic method to identify "vital layers" within DiT, crucial for image
formation, and demonstrate how these layers facilitate a range of controlled
stable edits, from non-rigid modifications to object addition, using the same
mechanism. Next, to enable real-image editing, we introduce an improved image
inversion method for flow models. Finally, we evaluate our approach through
qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with a user study, and
demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple applications. The project page is

### CoNFiLD-inlet: Synthetic Turbulence Inflow Using Generative Latent Diffusion Models with Neural Fields
**Authors**: Xin-Yang Liu, Meet Hemant Parikh, Xiantao Fan, Pan Du, Qing Wang, Yi-Fan Chen, Jian-Xun Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-11-21

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2411.14378v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14378v1)

**Abstract**: Eddy-resolving turbulence simulations require stochastic inflow conditions
that accurately replicate the complex, multi-scale structures of turbulence.
Traditional recycling-based methods rely on computationally expensive precursor
simulations, while existing synthetic inflow generators often fail to reproduce
realistic coherent structures of turbulence. Recent advances in deep learning
(DL) have opened new possibilities for inflow turbulence generation, yet many
DL-based methods rely on deterministic, autoregressive frameworks prone to
error accumulation, resulting in poor robustness for long-term predictions. In
this work, we present CoNFiLD-inlet, a novel DL-based inflow turbulence
generator that integrates diffusion models with a conditional neural field
(CNF)-encoded latent space to produce realistic, stochastic inflow turbulence.
By parameterizing inflow conditions using Reynolds numbers, CoNFiLD-inlet
generalizes effectively across a wide range of Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau$
between $10^3$ and $10^4$) without requiring retraining or parameter tuning.
Comprehensive validation through a priori and a posteriori tests in Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES)
demonstrates its high fidelity, robustness, and scalability, positioning it as
an efficient and versatile solution for inflow turbulence synthesis.


### Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation with Deep Learning and Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Houze Liu, Tong Zhou, Yanlin Xiang, Aoran Shen, Jiacheng Hu, Junliang Du

**Published Date**: 2024-11-21

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2411.14353v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14353v1)

**Abstract**: Medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate clinical diagnoses, yet it
faces challenges such as low contrast between lesions and normal tissues,
unclear boundaries, and high variability across patients. Deep learning has
improved segmentation accuracy and efficiency, but it still relies heavily on
expert annotations and struggles with the complexities of medical images. The
small size of medical image datasets and the high cost of data acquisition
further limit the performance of segmentation networks. Diffusion models, with
their iterative denoising process, offer a promising alternative for better
detail capture in segmentation. However, they face difficulties in accurately
segmenting small targets and maintaining the precision of boundary details.
This article discusses the importance of medical image segmentation, the
limitations of current deep learning approaches, and the potential of diffusion
models to address these challenges.


### A TVD neural network closure and application to turbulent combustion

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2408.03413v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03413v2)

**Abstract**: Trained neural networks (NN) have attractive features for closing governing
equations. There are many methods that are showing promise, but all can fail in
cases when small errors consequentially violate physical reality, such as a
solution boundedness condition. A NN formulation is introduced to preclude
spurious oscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is
embedded in the discretized equations as a machine learning closure and
strictly constrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for
hyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during
gradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto
an explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure
model usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and
anti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model
is applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for
which it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise
violate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of
oscillations in the loss function.


### SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization
**Authors**: Shuchen Zhu, Boao Kong, Songtao Lu, Xinmeng Huang, Kun Yuan

**Published Date**: 2024-11-21

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-21

**PDF Url**: [2411.14166v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14166v1)

**Abstract**: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple
agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures
with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes
gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without
exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or
Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical
decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting
to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual
AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the
flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the
algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper-
and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for
SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence
rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results
further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for
decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel
algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.
