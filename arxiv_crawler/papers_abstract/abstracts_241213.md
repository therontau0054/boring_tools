**Abstract**: We formulate a field theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting
nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear ($n$th)
power of momentum along $d_L$ ($d_M$) mutually orthogonal directions around a
few isolated points in the reciprocal space with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at
the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order
parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored
to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a
`small' parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of
identical fermion copies (flavor number). When applied to three-dimensional
interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the
Abelian monopole charge $n>1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation
($N_b=2$), a leading order RG analysis suggests Gaussian nature of the
underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume
mean-field values. A traditional field theoretic RG analysis yields same
outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$).
Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic
corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.


### Next-to-leading order evolution of structure functions without PDFs

**Abstract**: We formulate and numerically solve the
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi~(DGLAP) evolution equations at
next-to-leading order in perturbation theory directly for a basis of 6
physical, observable structure functions in deeply inelastic scattering. By
expressing the evolution in the physical basis one evades the factorization
scale and scheme dependence. Working in terms of observable quantities, rather
than parametrizing and fitting unobservable parton distribution functions
(PDFs), provides an unambiguous way to confront predictions of perturbative
Quantum Chromodynamics with experimental measurements. We compare numerical
results for the DGLAP evolution for structure functions in the physical basis
to the conventional evolution with PDFs.

**Authors**: Xueting Li, Ye Yuan, Shalini De Mello, Gilles Daviet, Jonathan Leaf, Miles Macklin, Jan Kautz, Umar Iqbal

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09545v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09545v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce SimAvatar, a framework designed to generate simulation-ready
clothed 3D human avatars from a text prompt. Current text-driven human avatar
generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a
unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for
simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in
representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging
established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g.,
Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural
simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that
combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and
garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D
generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from
the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion
models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair
strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the
avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the
garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians
through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our
synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the
best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic,
fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current
approaches.

**Authors**: Gustavo J. Turiaci

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09537v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09537v1)

**Abstract**: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry:
Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics"
that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the
exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and
supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to
black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli
spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in
other lectures of the school.


### Interpolating amplitudes
**Authors**: Víctor Bresó, Gudrun Heinrich, Vitaly Magerya, Anton Olsson

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09534v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09534v1)

**Abstract**: While the calculation of scattering amplitudes at higher orders in
perturbation theory has reached a high degree of maturity, their usage to
produce physical predictions within Monte Carlo programs is often hampered by
the slow evaluation of the multi-loop amplitudes, especially so for amplitudes
calculated numerically. As a remedy, interpolation frameworks have been
successfully used in lower dimensions, but for higher-dimensional problems,
such as the five dimensions of a 2 -> 3 phase space, efficient and reliable
solutions are sparse.
  This work aims to fill this gap by reviewing state-of-the-art interpolation
methods, and by assessing their performance for concrete examples drawn from
particle physics. Specifically, we investigate interpolation methods based on
polynomials, splines, spatially adaptive sparse grids, and neural networks
(multilayer perceptron and Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer).
Our additional aim is to motivate further studies of the interpolation of
scattering amplitudes among both physicists and mathematicians.


### High Precision Binding Energies from Physics Informed Machine Learning
**Authors**: Ian Bentley, James Tedder, Marwan Gebran, Ayan Paul

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09504v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09504v1)

**Abstract**: Twelve physics informed machine learning models have been trained to model
binding energy residuals. Our approach begins with determining the difference
between measured experimental binding energies and three different mass models.
Then four machine learning approaches are used to train on each energy
difference. The most successful ML technique both in interpolation and
extrapolation is the least squares boosted ensemble of trees. The best model
resulting from that technique utilizes eight physical features to model the
difference between experimental atomic binding energy values in AME 2012 and
the Duflo Zucker mass model. This resulted in a model that fit the training
data with a standard deviation of 17 keV and that has a standard deviation of
92 keV when compared all of the values in the AME 2020. The extrapolation
capability of each model is discussed and the accuracy of predicting new mass
measurements has also been tested.

**Authors**: Jai Bardhan, Cyrin Neeraj, Subhadip Mitra, Tanumoy Mandal

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09500v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09500v1)

**Abstract**: We construct a surrogate loss to directly optimise the significance metric
used in particle physics. We evaluate our loss function for a simple event
classification task using a linear model and show that it produces decision
boundaries that change according to the cross sections of the processes
involved. We find that the models trained with the new loss have higher signal
efficiency for similar values of estimated signal significance compared to ones
trained with a cross-entropy loss, showing promise to improve sensitivity of
particle physics searches at colliders.

**Authors**: Zachary J. Allamon, Quentin A. Hales, Andrew B. Royston, Douglas L. Rutledge, Erica A. Yozie

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09487v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09487v1)

**Abstract**: The forced soliton equation is the starting point for semiclassical
computations with solitons away from the small momentum transfer regime. This
paper develops necessary analytical and numerical tools for analyzing solutions
to the forced soliton equation in the context of two-dimensional models with
kinks. Results include a finite degree of freedom regularization of soliton
sector physics based on periodic and anti-periodic lattice models, a detailed
analysis of numerical solutions, and the development of perturbation theory in
the soliton momentum transfer to mass ratio Delta P/M. Numerical solutions at
large transfer, greater or similar to the soliton mass, are capable of
exhibiting, in a smooth and controlled fashion, extreme phenomena such as
soliton-antisoliton pair creation and superluminal collective coordinate
velocities, which we investigate.

**Abstract**: Periodically driven quantum systems can realize novel phases of matter that
are not present in time-independent Hamiltonians. One important application is
the engineering of synthetic gauge fields, which opens the realm of topological
many-body physics to neutral atom quantum simulators. In this work, we leverage
a neutral atom quantum simulator to experimentally realize the
strongly-interacting Mott-Meissner phase in large-scale, bosonic flux ladders
with 48 sites at half filling. By combining quantum gas microscopy with local
basis rotations, we reveal the emerging equilibrium particle currents with
local resolution across large systems. We find chiral currents exhibiting a
characteristic interaction scaling, providing direct experimental evidence of
the interacting Mott-Meissner phase. Moreover, we benchmark density
correlations with numerical simulations and find that the effective temperature
of the system is on the order of the tunnel coupling. Our results demonstrate
the feasibility of scaling periodically driven quantum systems to large,
strongly correlated phases, paving the way for exploring topological quantum
matter with single-atom resolution and control.


### Finite-PINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture for Solving Solid Mechanics Problems with General Geometries
**Authors**: Haolin Li, Yuyang Miao, Zahra Sharif Khodaei, M. H. Aliabadi

**PDF Url**: [2412.09453v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09453v1)

**Abstract**: PINN models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing fluid PDE
problems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This
study identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid
mechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the
limitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used
in solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a)
PINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with
the finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution
space utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the
complex geometries often present in solid structures.
  This work proposes a PINN architecture used for general solid mechanics
problems, termed the Finite-PINN model. The proposed model aims to effectively
address these two challenges while preserving as much of the original
implementation of PINN as possible. The unique architecture of the Finite-PINN
model addresses these challenges by separating the approximation of stress and
displacement fields, and by transforming the solution space from the
traditional Euclidean space to a Euclidean-topological joint space. Several
case studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the Finite-PINN model
provides satisfactory results for a variety of problem types, including both
forward and inverse problems, in both 2D and 3D contexts. The developed
Finite-PINN model offers a promising tool for addressing general solid
mechanics problems, particularly those not yet well-explored in current
research.


## Diffusion
### Training Free Guided Flow Matching with Optimal Control

**PDF Url**: [2410.18070v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18070v2)

**Abstract**: Controlled generation with pre-trained Diffusion and Flow Matching models has
vast applications. One strategy for guiding ODE-based generative models is
through optimizing a target loss $R(x_1)$ while staying close to the prior
distribution. Along this line, some recent work showed the effectiveness of
guiding flow model by differentiating through its ODE sampling process. Despite
the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods
is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover,
existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a
compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3),
which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We
present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework
for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in
optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for
solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic
theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3).
We show that existing backprop-through-ODE methods can be interpreted as
special cases of Euclidean OC-Flow. OC-Flow achieved superior performance in
extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule
generation, and all-atom peptide design.


### Learned Compression for Compressed Learning
**Authors**: Dan Jacobellis, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09405v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09405v1)

**Abstract**: Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due
to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of
this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows
models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective
resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not
ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned
compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality;
thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders
reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to
significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC
(Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines
linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders.
WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck
between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics,
WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion
models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent
high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB
images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear
operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile
computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We
demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several
tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding,
and music source separation. Our code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and
image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc


### UFO: Enhancing Diffusion-Based Video Generation with a Uniform Frame Organizer
**Authors**: Delong Liu, Zhaohui Hou, Mingjie Zhan, Shihao Han, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09389v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09389v1)

**Abstract**: Recently, diffusion-based video generation models have achieved significant
success. However, existing models often suffer from issues like weak
consistency and declining image quality over time. To overcome these
challenges, inspired by aesthetic principles, we propose a non-invasive plug-in
called Uniform Frame Organizer (UFO), which is compatible with any
diffusion-based video generation model. The UFO comprises a series of adaptive
adapters with adjustable intensities, which can significantly enhance the
consistency between the foreground and background of videos and improve image
quality without altering the original model parameters when integrated. The
training for UFO is simple, efficient, requires minimal resources, and supports
stylized training. Its modular design allows for the combination of multiple
UFOs, enabling the customization of personalized video generation models.
Furthermore, the UFO also supports direct transferability across different
models of the same specification without the need for specific retraining. The
experimental results indicate that UFO effectively enhances video generation
quality and demonstrates its superiority in public video generation benchmarks.
The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/UFO.


### Diffusion Model with Representation Alignment for Protein Inverse Folding
**Authors**: Chenglin Wang, Yucheng Zhou, Zijie Zhai, Jianbing Shen, Kai Zhang

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09380v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09380v1)

**Abstract**: Protein inverse folding is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics, aiming to
recover the amino acid sequences from a given protein backbone structure.
Despite the success of existing methods, they struggle to fully capture the
intricate inter-residue relationships critical for accurate sequence
prediction. We propose a novel method that leverages diffusion models with
representation alignment (DMRA), which enhances diffusion-based inverse folding
by (1) proposing a shared center that aggregates contextual information from
the entire protein structure and selectively distributes it to each residue;
and (2) aligning noisy hidden representations with clean semantic
representations during the denoising process. This is achieved by predefined
semantic representations for amino acid types and a representation alignment
method that utilizes type embeddings as semantic feedback to normalize each
residue. In experiments, we conduct extensive evaluations on the CATH4.2
dataset to demonstrate that DMRA outperforms leading methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance and exhibiting strong generalization capabilities
on the TS50 and TS500 datasets.


### Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints
**Authors**: Ralf Römer, Alexander von Rohr, Angela P. Schoellig

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2412.09342v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09342v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for policy learning in
robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal
distributions. However, diffusion policies are inherently stochastic and
typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic
conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be
satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control
with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit
state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data.
DPCC uses constraint tightening and incorporates model-based projections into
the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model. This allows us
to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching
trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot
manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel
test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control
task.
