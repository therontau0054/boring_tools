**Abstract**: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state
constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability
of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with
color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed
nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a
relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition
is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the
two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the
scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell
construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star
is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase
transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$.
The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of
state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark
matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 -
2.22~M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\odot$, the radii of
these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In
principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by
the hadronic reference equation of state.

**Abstract**: Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural
prediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features
in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a
unique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived
from Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial
fluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial
features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they
are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated
N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while
oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of
primordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure
formation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in
the matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be
used to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern
in the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for
constraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the
challenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes
relevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark
matter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary
physics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need
for refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.


### Towards a group structure for superluminal velocity boosts

**Abstract**: Canonical subluminal Lorentz boosts have a clear geometric interpretation.
They can be neatly expressed as hyperbolic rotations, that leave both the
family of $2$-sheet hyperboloids within the light cone, and the family
$1$-sheet hyperboloids exterior to it, invariant. In this work, we construct a
map between the two families of hypersurfaces and interpret the corresponding
operators as superluminal velocity boosts. Though a physical observer cannot
`jump' the light speed barrier, to pass from one regime to the other (at least
not classically), the existence of superluminal motion does not, by itself,
generate paradoxes. The implications of this construction for recent work on
the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed by Dragan and Ekert, are
discussed. The geometric picture reproduces their `superboost' operator in
$(1+1)$ dimensions but generalises to $(1+3)$ dimensions in a very different
way. This leaves open an important possibility, which appears to be closed to
existing models, namely, the possibility of embedding the superluminal boosts
within a group structure, without generating additional unwanted phenomenology,
that contradicts existing experimental results. We prove that the set
containing both subluminal and superluminal boosts forms a group, in
$(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes, and outline a program to extend these results
to higher-dimensional geometries.

**Abstract**: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases
with pairs of bands hosting nontrivial Euler class, a multigap invariant
characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the
combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further
restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider
the associated interband contributions to dc conductivities in the flat-band
limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of
transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and
demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through
the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a
direct measurement of this multiband invariant. Additionally, we prove that the
bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal
topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical
manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which
include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk
photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in
lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials
and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.

**PDF Url**: [2502.02558v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02558v1)

**Abstract**: Effective self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have been key to
unlocking large datasets for representation learning. While many promising
methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs,
their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized
knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked
modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection
Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but
locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at
millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric
tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic
patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory
semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked
Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification
F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While
the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with
sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To
support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC
dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy
physics (HEP). Project site: https://youngsm.com/polarmae/


### The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity
**Authors**: Matthew J. Lake

**Published Date**: 2024-10-09

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-04

**PDF Url**: [2410.07017v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07017v4)

**Abstract**: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in
Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames
\cite{Dragan:2022txt}, are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in
nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed
to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer,
travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator
together with an arbitrary relabeling. Physically, it corresponds to staying
put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as
`space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of
relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes
\cite{Dragan:2019grn}, to ordinary Minkowski space \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, is
simply Einstein's principle of relativity, proposed in 1905.


### Stability of the Standard Model Vacuum with Vector-Like Leptons: A Critical Examination
**Authors**: Kivanc Y. Cingiloglu, Mariana Frank

**Published Date**: 2024-08-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-04

**PDF Url**: [2408.10898v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10898v2)

**Abstract**: The stability of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs vacuum is a long-standing
issue in particle physics. The SM Higgs quartic coupling parameter is expected
to become negative at high scales, potentially generating an unstable vacuum
well before reaching the Planck scale. We investigate whether the introduction
of vector-like leptons (VLLs) in six distinct gauge anomaly-independent
representations can stabilize the SM vacuum without introducing additional
scalar fields. By analyzing the mass spectrum and mixing angles of these VLLs
with the SM leptons, we identify conditions under which the Higgs potential
remains stable. We demonstrate that there exists a set of allowed but narrowed
VLL spectra that can indeed stabilize the SM vacuum. We also study the effect
of these VLLs on electroweak precision observables, particularly the oblique
parameters S and T to ensure fit within global experimental constraints.
Finally, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space allowed by
electroweak precision data and the parameter space required for stability,
highlighting cases that accommodate both. This study opens up new avenues for
understanding the role of vector-like leptons in extending the validity of the
Standard Model up to the Planck scale.


### Local Reduced-Order Modeling for Electrostatic Plasmas by Physics-Informed Solution Manifold Decomposition

**Abstract**: Despite advancements in high-performance computing and modern numerical
algorithms, computational cost remains prohibitive for multi-query kinetic
plasma simulations. In this work, we develop data-driven reduced-order models
(ROMs) for collisionless electrostatic plasma dynamics, based on the kinetic
Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our ROM approach projects the equation onto a linear
subspace defined by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes. We
introduce an efficient tensorial method to update the nonlinear term using a
precomputed third-order tensor. We capture multiscale behavior with a minimal
number of POD modes by decomposing the solution manifold into multiple time
windows and creating temporally local ROMs. We consider two strategies for
decomposition: one based on the physical time and the other based on the
electric field energy. Applied to the 1D1V Vlasov-Poisson simulations, that is,
prescribed E-field, Landau damping, and two-stream instability, we demonstrate
that our ROMs accurately capture the total energy of the system both for
parametric and time extrapolation cases. The temporally local ROMs are more
efficient and accurate than the single ROM. In addition, in the two-stream
instability case, we show that the energy-windowing reduced-order model
(EW-ROM) is more efficient and accurate than the time-windowing reduced-order
model (TW-ROM). With the tensorial approach, EW-ROM solves the equation
approximately 90 times faster than Eulerian simulations while maintaining a
maximum relative error of 7.5% for the training data and 11% for the testing
data.


### Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment

**Abstract**: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated
photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design
where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure
reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However,
discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed.
These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated
photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise
simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In
this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density
changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving
experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron
microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We
find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as
feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using
a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we
achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify
the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters
that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial
for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable
simulation of photonic integrated devices.


### Learning to generate physical ocean states: Towards hybrid climate modeling
**Authors**: Etienne Meunier, David Kamm, Guillaume Gachon, Redouane Lguensat, Julie Deshayes

**Published Date**: 2025-02-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-04

**PDF Url**: [2502.02499v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02499v1)

**Abstract**: Ocean General Circulation Models require extensive computational resources to
reach equilibrium states, while deep learning emulators, despite offering fast
predictions, lack the physical interpretability and long-term stability
necessary for climate scientists to understand climate sensitivity (to
greenhouse gas emissions) and mechanisms of abrupt % variability such as
tipping points. We propose to take the best from both worlds by leveraging deep
generative models to produce physically consistent oceanic states that can
serve as initial conditions for climate projections. We assess the viability of
this hybrid approach through both physical metrics and numerical experiments,
and highlight the benefits of enforcing physical constraints during generation.
Although we train here on ocean variables from idealized numerical simulations,
we claim that this hybrid approach, combining the computational efficiency of
deep learning with the physical accuracy of numerical models, can effectively
reduce the computational burden of running climate models to equilibrium, and
reduce uncertainties in climate projections by minimizing drifts in baseline
simulations.

**Abstract**: The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological
advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must
effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite
design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying
framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline
materials. OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base
distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class
of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow
matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by
integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and
extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell
representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates
and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We
benchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)
for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering
stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMG,
we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMG
establishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials
discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.
These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning
frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science.


### UFID: A Unified Framework for Input-level Backdoor Detection on Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Zihan Guan, Mengxuan Hu, Sheng Li, Anil Vullikanti

**Published Date**: 2024-04-01

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-04

**PDF Url**: [2404.01101v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01101v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious
attackers inject backdoors by poisoning certain training samples during the
training stage. This poses a significant threat to real-world applications in
the Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) scenario, where users query diffusion models
through APIs or directly download them from the internet. To mitigate the
threat of backdoor attacks under MaaS, black-box input-level backdoor detection
has drawn recent interest, where defenders aim to build a firewall that filters
out backdoor samples in the inference stage, with access only to input queries
and the generated results from diffusion models. Despite some preliminary
explorations on the traditional classification tasks, these methods cannot be
directly applied to the generative tasks due to two major challenges: (1) more
diverse failures and (2) a multi-modality attack surface. In this paper, we
propose a black-box input-level backdoor detection framework on diffusion
models, called UFID. Our defense is motivated by an insightful causal analysis:
Backdoor attacks serve as the confounder, introducing a spurious path from
input to target images, which remains consistent even when we perturb the input
samples with Gaussian noise. We further validate the intuition with theoretical
analysis. Extensive experiments across different datasets on both conditional
and unconditional diffusion models show that our method achieves superb
performance on detection effectiveness and run-time efficiency.

**PDF Url**: [2502.02514v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02514v1)

**Abstract**: Image autoregressive (IAR) models have surpassed diffusion models (DMs) in
both image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) and generation speed. However, their
privacy risks remain largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive privacy analysis comparing IARs to DMs. We develop a novel
membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a significantly higher success
rate in detecting training images (TPR@FPR=1%: 86.38% for IARs vs. 4.91% for
DMs). Using this MIA, we perform dataset inference (DI) and find that IARs
require as few as six samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 for
DMs, indicating higher information leakage. Additionally, we extract hundreds
of training images from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our findings highlight
a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in generation quality
and speed, they are significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks. This
suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs, such as per-token probability
modeling using diffusion, could help mitigate IARs' privacy risks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars.


### Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching
**Authors**: Marco Bertolini, Tuan Le, Djork-Arné Clevert

**Published Date**: 2025-02-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-04

**PDF Url**: [2502.02513v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02513v1)

**Abstract**: We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on
Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach
yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra
representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in
Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of
learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any
target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching
emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the
translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as
solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs),
introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through
experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in
real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and
modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking,
showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself.
We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by
reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the
modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we
demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow
matching.


### Do Graph Diffusion Models Accurately Capture and Generate Substructure Distributions?

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-04

**PDF Url**: [2502.02488v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02488v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have gained popularity in graph generation tasks; however,
the extent of their expressivity concerning the graph distributions they can
learn is not fully understood. Unlike models in other domains, popular
backbones for graph diffusion models, such as Graph Transformers, do not
possess universal expressivity to accurately model the distribution scores of
complex graph data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on the
frequency of specific substructures as a key characteristic of target graph
distributions. When evaluating existing models using this metric, we find that
they fail to maintain the distribution of substructure counts observed in the
training set when generating new graphs. To address this issue, we establish a
theoretical connection between the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
and the overall performance of graph diffusion models, demonstrating that more
expressive GNN backbones can better capture complex distribution patterns. By
integrating advanced GNNs into the backbone architecture, we achieve
significant improvements in substructure generation.
