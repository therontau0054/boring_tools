**Abstract**: Non-Markovian dynamics go beyond the Markovian approximation by capturing
memory effects and information backflow in open quantum systems, which are
crucial for describing realistic physical processes. In this work, we study the
exact non-Markovian dynamics of a driven cavity coupled to an anisotropic
three-dimensional photonic-crystal environment via counterrotating-wave
interactions. We derive an exact analytical expression for the cavity amplitude
satisfying the integro-differential equation, which includes the contributions
of the bound states outside the continuum and the dissipative parts with the
continuum spectrum. Based on the characteristic function method, we derive the
exact non-Markovian master equation for the cavity, which contributes to the
gain of the cavity. We give the physical origin of non-Markovian gain in the
presence of bound states in the system consisting of cavity and environment,
which has no Markovian counterparts due to the nonexponential gain in the
non-Markovian structured environment. We find that three different types of
bound states can be formed in the system, containing one bound state with no
inversion of photon number, two bound states with the periodic equal-amplitude
oscillation, and the gain with two complex roots without the bound states
formation. We derive a current equation including the source from the driving
field, the transient current induced by the change in the number of photons,
and the two-photon current caused by the counterrotating-wave term. The results
are compared with those given by the rotating-wave interactions and extended to
a more general quantum network involving an arbitrary number of coupled
cavities. Our findings may pave the way for a deeper understanding of
non-Markovian dynamics with gain in quantum networks involving
counterrotating-wave effects.

**Abstract**: Federated learning is a machine learning method that supports training models
on decentralized devices or servers, where each holds its local data, removing
the need for data exchange. This approach is especially useful in healthcare,
as it enables training on sensitive data without needing to share them. The
nature of federated learning necessitates robust security precautions due to
data leakage concerns during communication. To address this issue, we propose a
new approach that employs selective encryption, homomorphic encryption,
differential privacy, and bit-wise scrambling to minimize data leakage while
achieving good execution performance. Our technique , FAS (fast and secure
federated learning) is used to train deep learning models on medical imaging
data. We implemented our technique using the Flower framework and compared with
a state-of-the-art federated learning approach that also uses selective
homomorphic encryption. Our experiments were run in a cluster of eleven
physical machines to create a real-world federated learning scenario on
different datasets. We observed that our approach is up to 90\% faster than
applying fully homomorphic encryption on the model weights. In addition, we can
avoid the pretraining step that is required by our competitor and can save up
to 46% in terms of total execution time. While our approach was faster, it
obtained similar security results as the competitor.

**Abstract**: New high-precision microwave spectroscopic measurements and analysis of
rotational energy level transitions in the ground vibronic state of the
open-shell BaF molecule are reported with the purpose of contributing to
studies of physics beyond the Standard Model. BaF is currently among the key
candidate molecules being examined in the searches for a measurable electron
electric dipole moment, eEDM, as well as the nuclear anapole moment. Employing
Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy, these new pure rotational transition
frequencies for the 138Ba19F, 137Ba19F, 136Ba19F, 135Ba19F, and 134Ba19F
isotopologues are analyzed here in a combined global fit with previous
microwave data sets for 138Ba19F (v = 0 - 4), 137Ba19F, and 136Ba19F using the
program SPFIT. As a result, hyperfine parameters are significantly improved,
and we observe a distinctive structure in a Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB)
analysis of the primary rotational constant. This can be understood using the
nuclear field shifts due to the known isotopic variation in the size of barium
nuclei and in combination with the smaller linear mass-dependent BOB terms.


### Everything everywhere all at once: a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events
**Authors**: Enrico Trizio, Peilin Kang, Michele Parrinello

**Published Date**: 2024-10-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-27

**PDF Url**: [2410.17029v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17029v4)

**Abstract**: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer
simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460,
2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through
the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the
committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition
state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure
by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a
logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This
integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free
energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied
with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases
in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are
encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained
from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full
characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this
approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.

**PDF Url**: [2503.21680v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21680v1)

**Abstract**: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we show
the existence of (i) a couple of off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) BRST and
co-BRST symmetry transformations, and (ii) a full set of non-nilpotent (i.e.
bosonic) symmetry transformations for an appropriate Lagrangian density that
describes the combined system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge
theories in the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensions of the flat Minkowskian
spacetime. We concentrate on the full algebraic structures of the above
continuous symmetry transformation operators along with a couple of very useful
discrete duality symmetry transformation operators existing in our four (3 +
1)-dimensional (4D) field-theoretic model. We establish the relevance of the
algebraic structures, respected by the above discrete and continuous symmetry
operators, to the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham
cohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the highlights of our
present endeavor is the observation that there are no ``exotic'' fields with
the negative kinetic terms in our present 4D field-theoretic example for Hodge
theory.

**Abstract**: One of the core components of our world models is 'intuitive physics' - an
understanding of objects, space, and causality. This capability enables us to
predict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a
composite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,
unified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide
insights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview
of the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,
enactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core
capabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what
functional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given
the foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding
objecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we
evaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities
compared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a
combination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying
objecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,
whilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of
objecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional
integration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge
fully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the
integrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are
promising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward
general-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.


### Fracton and Non-Lorentzian Particle Duality: Gauge Field Couplings and Geometric Implications
**Authors**: M. M. Ahmadi-Jahmani, A. Parvizi

**PDF Url**: [2503.21660v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21660v1)

**Abstract**: Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment
conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to
tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores
the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and
Galilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical
actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of
motion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with
electric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond
to both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic
underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,
revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean
algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric
framework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime
geometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and
ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity
and exotic condensed matter systems.


### Logging the conformal life of Ramanujan's $π$

**Abstract**: In 1914, Ramanujan presented 17 infinite series for $1/\pi$. We examine the
physics origin of these remarkable formulae by connecting them to 2D
logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) which arise in various contexts
such as the fractional quantum hall effect, percolation and polymers. In light
of the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the
physics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and
the conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel
approximations for $1/\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series
motivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators
to find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the
parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed
for string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in
the new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire
contribution to $1/\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting
at a universal property of LCFTs. Additionally, the dispersive representation
gives us a new handle on the double-lightcone limit.


### Electric conductivity in graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model
**Authors**: Pablo Rodriguez-Lopez, Jian-Sheng Wang, Mauro Antezza

**Published Date**: 2024-03-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-27

**PDF Url**: [2403.02279v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02279v3)

**Abstract**: We compare three models of graphene electric conductivity: a non-local Kubo
model, a local model derived by Falkovsky, and finally, a non-local quantum
field theory (QFT) polarization-based model. These models are supposed to
provide consistent results since they are derived from the same Hamiltonian.
While we confirm that the local model is a proper $\textbf{q}\to\textbf{0}$
limit of both the non-local Kubo and the non-local QFT model (once losses are
added to this last model), we find hard inconsistencies in the non-local QFT
model as derived and currently used in literature. In particular, in the
genuine non-local region ($\textbf{q}\neq\textbf{0}$), the available QFT model
shows an intrinsic non-physical plasma-like behavior for the interband
transversal electric conductivity at low frequencies (even after introducing
the unavoidable losses). The Kubo model, instead, shows the expected behavior,
i.e., an almost constant electric conductivity as a function of frequency
$\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega<\sqrt{(\hbar v_F
q)^{2}+4m^{2}}$. We show that the Kubo and QFT models can be expressed using an
identical Polarization operator $\Pi_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$, but they
employ different expressions for the electric conductivity
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$. In particular, the Kubo model uses a
standard regularized expression, a direct consequence of Ohm's Law and
causality, as we rigorously re-derive. We show that, once the standard
regularized expression for $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$ is used in the
QFT model, and losses are included, the Kubo and QFT model coincide, and all
its anomalies naturally disappear. Our findings show the necessity to
appropriately define and regularize the electric conductivity to connect it
with the available QFT model.


### Vortex-Free Intrinsic Orbital Angular Momentum

**Abstract**: For three decades, optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been synonymous
with phase vortices. Here, our research challenges this paradigm by
demonstrating a vortex-free intrinsic OAM arising from three-dimensional
caustic trajectories in structured light fields, distinct from traditional
vortex-based mechanisms. Optical OAM was traditionally considered rare,
predominantly manifesting during high-order atomic and molecular transitions.
The conceptual shift initiated by Allen et al. in 1992, which showed that laser
beams with optical vortex--characterized by their twisted wavefronts--naturally
carry intrinsic OAM, laid the groundwork for subsequent studies. However, the
exploration of intrinsic OAM in vortex-free laser modes remains a largely
untapped area. Addressing this gap, our research proposes a third category of
optical intrinsic angular momentum--termed "vortex-free OAM"--that complements
spin angular momentum (SAM) in circularly polarized beams and OAM in vortex
beams. This new form of OAM is governed by a hydrodynamic analogy between light
propagation and fluid dynamics, linking the orbital motion of energy
streamlines to quantifiable angular momentum. Through numerical simulations,
experimental measurements, and investigations of the mechanical transfer of OAM
to trapped particles using optical tweezers, we establish vortex-free OAM as a
universal property of structured fields with three-dimensional caustic
trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a unified hydrodynamic framework that
transcends traditional wavefront-centric models, facilitating the
generalization of OAM analysis to both vortex and vortex-free regimes. This
framework not only enhances our understanding of the physical origin of optical
angular momentum but also unlocks new opportunities in optical manipulation,
classical and quantum communications, and light-matter interaction
technologies.


## Diffusion
### StyleMotif: Multi-Modal Motion Stylization using Style-Content Cross Fusion
**Authors**: Ziyu Guo, Young Yoon Lee, Joseph Liu, Yizhak Ben-Shabat, Victor Zordan, Mubbasir Kapadia

**Published Date**: 2025-03-27

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-27

**PDF Url**: [2503.21775v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21775v1)

**Abstract**: We present StyleMotif, a novel Stylized Motion Latent Diffusion model,
generating motion conditioned on both content and style from multiple
modalities. Unlike existing approaches that either focus on generating diverse
motion content or transferring style from sequences, StyleMotif seamlessly
synthesizes motion across a wide range of content while incorporating stylistic
cues from multi-modal inputs, including motion, text, image, video, and audio.
To achieve this, we introduce a style-content cross fusion mechanism and align
a style encoder with a pre-trained multi-modal model, ensuring that the
generated motion accurately captures the reference style while preserving
realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework surpasses
existing methods in stylized motion generation and exhibits emergent
capabilities for multi-modal motion stylization, enabling more nuanced motion
synthesis. Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.

### A Unified Framework for Diffusion Bridge Problems: Flow Matching and Schrödinger Matching into One
**Authors**: Minyoung Kim

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-27

**PDF Url**: [2503.21756v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21756v1)

**Abstract**: The bridge problem is to find an SDE (or sometimes an ODE) that bridges two
given distributions. The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous,
among which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional
image generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr\"{o}dinger bridge
problem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the
bridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in
the deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting
algorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter
specifically for the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of
this article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms
with technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified
perspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms
(and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified
framework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch)
optimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr\"{o}dinger bridge FM
algorithm, and the deep Schr\"{o}dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its
special cases. We believe that this unified framework will be useful for
viewing the bridge problems in a more general and flexible perspective, and in
turn can help researchers and practitioners to develop new bridge algorithms in
their fields.

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in diffusion techniques have propelled image and video
generation to unprecedented levels of quality, significantly accelerating the
deployment and application of generative AI. However, 3D shape generation
technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data
scale, complexity of 3D data processing, and insufficient exploration of
advanced techniques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation
face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization
capability, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new
streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D
meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose:
1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving
state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2)
A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses
for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data
processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting
the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative
models. Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness
of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts
has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape
generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to
high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input
images. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D
models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization
capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation,
we will make our model publicly available.


### Adaptive Orchestration for Large-Scale Inference on Heterogeneous Accelerator Systems Balancing Cost, Performance, and Resilience

**PDF Url**: [2503.20074v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20074v2)

**Abstract**: The surge in generative AI workloads has created a need for scalable
inference systems that can flexibly harness both GPUs and specialized
accelerators while containing operational costs. This paper proposes a
hardware-agnostic control loop that adaptively allocates requests across
heterogeneous accelerators based on real-time cost and capacity signals. The
approach sustains low latency and high throughput by dynamically shifting
between cost-optimized and capacity-optimized modes, ensuring the most
efficient use of expensive compute resources under fluctuating availability.
Evaluated using the Stable Diffusion model, the framework consistently meets
latency targets, automatically redirects traffic during capacity shortfalls,
and capitalizes on lower-cost accelerators when possible. These results
highlight how a feedback-driven deployment strategy, spanning the entire
software and hardware stack, can help organizations efficiently scale
generative AI workloads while maintaining resilience in the face of limited
accelerator capacity.


### Progressive Rendering Distillation: Adapting Stable Diffusion for Instant Text-to-Mesh Generation without 3D Data

**Abstract**: It is highly desirable to obtain a model that can generate high-quality 3D
meshes from text prompts in just seconds. While recent attempts have adapted
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into
generators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor
quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at
overcoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as
Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D
ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a
native 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to
progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each
step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion
models, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill
text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score
distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can
easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for
challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate
the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we
train a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\%$
trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo
outperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.
Specifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and
generalize well for challenging text input. The code is available at
https://github.com/theEricMa/TriplaneTurbo.

**Abstract**: Quantitative investment (quant) is an emerging, technology-driven approach in
asset management, increasingy shaped by advancements in artificial
intelligence. Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs)
for quant finance have improved predictive modeling and enabled agent-based
automation, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in this field. In this
survey, taking alpha strategy as a representative example, we explore how AI
contributes to the quantitative investment pipeline. We first examine the early
stage of quant research, centered on human-crafted features and traditional
statistical models with an established alpha pipeline. We then discuss the rise
of deep learning, which enabled scalable modeling across the entire pipeline
from data processing to order execution. Building on this, we highlight the
emerging role of LLMs in extending AI beyond prediction, empowering autonomous
agents to process unstructured data, generate alphas, and support
self-iterative workflows.
