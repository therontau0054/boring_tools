**Abstract**: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice
gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand
string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make
connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we
study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between
two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We
calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string
configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances
determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various
string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance
strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields,
we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in
maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical
regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the
latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics
(QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and
trapped-ion quantum processors.

**Abstract**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.
Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework
that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar
spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical
information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral
datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support
diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves
pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed
by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different
instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve
spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between
spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information
between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework
enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We
demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets
improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and
chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and
precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.
Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities
offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively
trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance
precision stellar spectroscopy.

**Abstract**: Relationality is the paradigmatic conceptual core of general-relativistic
gauge field theory. It can be made manifest via the Dressing Field Method (DFM)
of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to achieve gauge-invariance by
extracting the physical degrees of freedom representing relations among field
variables. We review and further expand on some applications of the DFM to the
very foundations of the supersymmetric framework, where it allows to build
relational supersymmetric field theory and (dis)solves crucial issues.
Furthermore, we elaborate on a novel approach within the relational
supersymmetric field theory framework giving a unified description of fermionic
matter fields and bosonic gauge fields, and thus close to Berezin's original
motivation for the introduction of supergeometry in fundamental physics: a
Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Unification (MISU). This new approach stands
irrespective from the ultimate empirical status of standard supersymmetric
field theory, about which it is agnostic.

**Abstract**: Many chirality-sensitive light-matter interactions are governed by chiral
electron dynamics. Therefore, the development of advanced technologies
harnessing chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and
controlling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond time scales.
Such endeavors have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized
circularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been
overcome (Han et al. Optica 10 (2023) 1044-1052, Han et al. Nature Physics 19
(2023) 230-236). In this article, we introduce chiroptical spectroscopy with
attosecond pulses and demonstrate attosecond coherent control over
photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) (Goetz et al. Physical Review Letters
122 (2019) 013204, Goetz et al. arXiv:2104.07522), as well as the measurement
of chiral asymmetries in the forward-backward and angle-resolved
photoionisation delays of chiral molecules. We show that co-rotating attosecond
and near-infrared pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign
compared to single-photon ionisation. We demonstrate that chiral
photoionisation delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of
photoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring three-dimensional
momentum resolution. We measure forward-backward chiral-sensitive delays of up
to 120 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionisation delays up to 240 as, which
include an asymmmetry of $\sim$60 as originating from chirality in the
continuum-continuum transitions. Attosecond chiroptical spectroscopy opens the
door to quantitatively understanding and controlling the dynamics of chiral
molecules on the electronic time scale.

**Abstract**: The main objective of this study is to simulate the behavior of the reactive
flow of the turbulent flame in aeronautical combustion chamber of the
ALLISON-T56 turboprop, and contribute to the analysis of flame structure and
determine for given pressure and temperature of fresh gas the behavior of the
thermodynamic parameters of combustion. The numerical approach is based on the
resolution of basic equations of turbulent combustion using Ansys-Fluent code
where the turbulence model K-e is chosen, the geometry of the combustion
chamber is made using Ansys-workbench software. Thereafter, we simulate the
transient temperature field through the wall of a tubular combustion chamber,
and the characterization of the thermal expansion, the thermoelastic stresses
and strains with the physical properties of refractory materials. The obtained
results are then compared with the results of the scientific literature

**Abstract**: The study of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics remains one of the
most exciting research frontiers of physics, standing at the crossroads of our
understanding of complex quantum phenomena and the realization of quantum
advantage. Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically
require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and
imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum
circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for
quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising
path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational
ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli
propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that
implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and
beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to
$30 \times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard
Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To
experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on
Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's
dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without
optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a
practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced
quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of
hardware-friendly ans\"atze.


### Transient dispersion in oscillatory flows: auxiliary-time extension method for concentration moments
**Authors**: Weiquan Jiang, Guoqian Chen

**Published Date**: 2025-07-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2507.01870v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01870v1)

**Abstract**: The dispersion phenomenon of mass and heat transport in oscillatory flows has
wide applications in environmental, physiological and microfluidic flows. The
method of concentration moments is a powerful theoretical tool for analyzing
transport characteristics and is well-developed for steady flows. However, the
general solutions of moments derived by Barton (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983,
pp. 205-218) cannot be applied directly to unsteady flows. Prior studies needed
to re-solve the governing equations of moments from scratch, encountering the
complication induced by the time-periodic velocity, leaving higher-order
statistics like skewness and kurtosis analytically intractable except for
specific cases. This work proposes a novel approach based on a
two-time-variable extension to tackle these challenges. By introducing an
auxiliary time variable, referred to as oscillation time to characterize the
inherent oscillation in the dispersion due to the oscillating flow, the
transport problem is extended to a two-time-variable system with a "steady"
flow term. This enables the direct use of Barton's expressions and thus avoids
the prior complication. This approach not only offers an intuitive physical
perspective for the influence of the velocity oscillation but also clarifies
the solution structure of concentration moments. As a preliminary verification,
we examine the transport problem in an oscillatory Couette flow. The analytical
solution agrees well with the numerical result by Brownian dynamics
simulations. The effects of the point-source release and the phase shift of
velocity on the transport characteristics are investigated. By extending the
classic steady-flow solution to the time-dependent flows, this work provides a
versatile framework for transient dispersion analysis, enhancing predictions in
oscillatory transport problems.


### Direct Vertex Reconstruction of $Λ$ Baryons from Hits in CLAS12 using Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Keegan Menkce, Matthew McEneaney, Anselm Vossen

**Published Date**: 2025-07-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2507.01868v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01868v1)

**Abstract**: Machine learning techniques, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have
been used extensively for data analysis in high energy and nuclear physics.
Here we report on the use of a GNN to reconstruct decay vertices of $\Lambda$
hyperons directly from hits in the tracking detector at the CLAS12 experiment
at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). We show that we can improve the vertex
reconstruction in simulation compared to the standard, track based, algorithm.
We believe this warrants further study. The current study is limited by
available training resources but points to an interesting possibility to forgo
vertex reconstruction by track fitting in a complicated magnetic field for a
more direct approach where the hit to vertex mapping is encoded in a neural
network.

**Abstract**: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling.
We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package ``PySR" to model
the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the flavor isovector combination
$H_{u-d}(x,t,\xi)$ at $\xi=0$. These PySR models were trained on GPD results
provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We
demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of
Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor
expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher
complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific
physics hypotheses, including force-factorized $x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge
behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources
based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise
behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in a wide range in $x$ and $t$,
crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic
spatial distributions and their derived quantities.

**PDF Url**: [2507.01864v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01864v1)

**Abstract**: After briefly touching on relativistic hydrodynamics, we provide a detailed
description of recent developments in spin hydrodynamics. We discuss the theory
of perfect spin hydrodynamics within two different approaches, which lead to
identical generalized thermodynamic relations. We also indicate the
applicability range of the theory, finding it compatible with the conditions
existing in the late stages of heavy-ion collisions. Finally, we discuss the
near-equilibrium dynamics.

### AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation
**Authors**: Sixiang Chen, Jiaming Liu, Siyuan Qian, Han Jiang, Lily Li, Renrui Zhang, Zhuoyang Liu, Chenyang Gu, Chengkai Hou, Pengwei Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Shanghang Zhang

**Abstract**: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling
language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing
methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,
primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly
model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily
leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual
observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct
multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile
manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion
Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination
for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base
directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body
conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion
representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body
actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact
of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at
different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware
multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights
between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features
tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for
example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial
for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric
information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile
manipulation tasks.


### Improving Consistency Models with Generator-Augmented Flows
**Authors**: Thibaut Issenhuth, Sangchul Lee, Ludovic Dos Santos, Jean-Yves Franceschi, Chansoo Kim, Alain Rakotomamonjy

**Published Date**: 2024-06-13

**PDF Url**: [2406.09570v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09570v4)

**Abstract**: Consistency models imitate the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion
in a single forward pass of a neural network. They can be learned in two ways:
consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the
true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by
a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample
Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error
induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we
show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we
propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding
outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the
previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost.
Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence
but also enhances its overall performance. The code is available at:

### There and Back Again: On the relation between Noise and Image Inversions in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Łukasz Staniszewski, Łukasz Kuciński, Kamil Deja

**Published Date**: 2024-10-31

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2410.23530v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23530v3)

**Abstract**: Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new
samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into
meaningful features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the
denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting
noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the
relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their
corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we
show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise
predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we
present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than
the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon,
demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction
error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the
image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM
Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully
decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and
interpolations. The code is available at https://github.com/luk-st/taba.


### EP-Diffuser: An Efficient Diffusion Model for Traffic Scene Generation and Prediction via Polynomial Representations
**Authors**: Yue Yao, Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi, Daniel Goehring, Joerg Reichardt

**Published Date**: 2025-04-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2504.05422v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05422v2)

**Abstract**: As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of
traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of
agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on
forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of
autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for
plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a
novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture
the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road
layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse,
plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models
in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2
dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves
both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further
evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test
setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.


### Loss Functions in Diffusion Models: A Comparative Study
**Authors**: Dibyanshu Kumar, Philipp Vaeth, Magda Gregorová

**Published Date**: 2025-07-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2507.01516v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01516v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.
