**Abstract**: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological
properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear.
Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental
band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating
candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state
characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2
chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states.
Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi
arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoe-
mission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials
and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our
understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic
symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.

**Abstract**: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to
use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve
this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific
non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a
qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for
creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design
a specialized anyon interferometer to measure the total charge remotely for
well-separated anyons; this avoids fusing them together. These protocols enable
the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active
quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation
process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we
encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel,
quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the
logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal
offers a promising path to realize universal topological quantum computation in
the NISQ era.

**Abstract**: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic
structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of
efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy.
Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the
associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the
number of integrals required to define differential equations for the
wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is
automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting
the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we
develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which
dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop
graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction
coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues
that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat
space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using
intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that
enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms
without any calculation.

**Abstract**: Advancements in computing power have made it possible to numerically simulate
large-scale fluid-mechanical and/or particulate systems, many of which are
integral to core industrial processes. Among the different numerical methods
available, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate
representations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and
discontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted
approach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and
powder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical
processes taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is
computationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of
particulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles.
Towards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow
numerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM
is capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes
using macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model
parameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an
underlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior
directly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces
multi-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of
industrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and
transient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for
deep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM
fluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for
trajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering
and much faster process cycles.

**PDF Url**: [2411.09663v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09663v1)

**Abstract**: The ATLAS collaboration at the LHC has published inclusive cross-section
measurements for the single-top and $t\bar{t}$ production modes at
center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 5.02, 8.16$, $13, 13.6$ TeV. Single-top
measurements are conducted in the $t$-channel and $tW$ channel. In addition to
the nominal cross-section measurements, various measurements of other
interesting observables such as $|f_{\text{LV}}V_{\text{tb}}|$, $R_\text{t}$,
$R_{t\bar{t}/Z}$, and $R_{\text{pA}}$ are also reported. These results are
compared to their corresponding SM predictions, calculated at (N)NLO in QCD.
All results are in good agreement with SM predictions.


### Differentiable Land Model Reveals Global Environmental Controls on Ecological Parameters

**Abstract**: Accurate modeling of terrestrial carbon and water exchange requires robust
ecological parameters that capture vegetation responses and adaptations to the
local environment. The current generation of land models use Plant Functional
Types (PFTs) to discretize vegetation functional diversity, but these coarse
categorizations often overlook fine-scale variations shaped by local climate,
soil, and forest age factors. The lack of governing equations for plant
adaptation demands a paradigm shift in how we integrate diverse Earth
observations to uncover ecological functional dependence on changing
environments. To address this challenge, we developed DifferLand, a
differentiable, hybrid physics and machine learning model that infers the
spatial distributions of ecological parameters and their relationships with
environmental factors constrained by satellite and in-situ observations. Our
model unifies top-down and bottom-up observational constraints with
process-based knowledge to generate a global analysis of ecological functions
and their adaptation to environmental gradients. We found PFTs account for less
than half of the explainable spatial parameter variations controlling carbon
fluxes and vegetation states. The remaining parameter variability is largely
driven by local climate and forest demography factors, and the learned
environment-parameter relationships lead to enhanced spatial generalization at
unseen locations. DifferLand identified growing season length, leaf economics,
and agricultural intensity as the three orthogonal spatial gradients underlying
parameter variations. Our novel framework can lead to new insights on global
carbon cycling by learning directly from data and expanding our understanding
of local responses of ecosystems to environmental drivers.


### Unitarization of electron scattering with an external potential at NLO in QED
**Authors**: J. A. Oller, Marcela Peláez

**Published Date**: 2024-07-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-14

**PDF Url**: [2407.15382v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15382v2)

**Abstract**: We have calculated the one-loop scattering amplitude of an electron by an
external Coulomb potential in QED free of infrared divergences. This feature is
achieved by applying the Faddeev-Kulish formalism, which implies a redefinition
of both the asymptotic electronic states and of the $S$ matrix. Additionally,
we have also derived the infrared-finite one-loop partial-wave amplitudes for
this process by applying a recent method in the literature. Next, these
partial-wave amplitudes are unitarized based on analyticity and unitarity by
employing three different methods of unitarization: the algebraic $N/D$ method,
the Inverse Amplitude Method and the first iterated $N/D$ method. Then, we have
studied several partial waves both for physical momentum and for complex ones
to look for bound-state poles. The binding momentum for the fundamental bound
state in $S$ wave is discussed with special detail. This is a wide-ranging
method for calculating nonperturbative partial-wave amplitudes for
infinite-range interactions that could be applied to many other systems.


### The lowest-radiation environments in the Solar System: new opportunities for underground rare-event searches
**Authors**: Xilin Zhang, Jason Detwiler, Clint Wiseman

**Published Date**: 2024-11-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-14

**PDF Url**: [2411.09634v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09634v1)

**Abstract**: We study neutrino, muon, and gamma-ray fluxes in extraterrestrial
environments in our Solar System via semi-analytical estimates and Monte Carlo
simulations. In sites with negligible atmosphere, we find a strong reduction in
the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino and muon fluxes relative to their intensities
on Earth. Neutrinos with energies between 50 MeV and 100 TeV show particularly
strong suppression, by as much as 10$^3$, even at shallow depths. The solar
neutrino suppression increases as the square of the site's distance from the
Sun. Natural radiation due to nuclear decay is also expected to be lower in
many of these locations and may be reduced to effectively negligible levels in
the liquid water environments. The sites satisfying these characteristics
represent an opportunity for greatly extending the physics reach of underground
searches in fundamental physics, such as searches for WIMP Dark Matter,
neutrinoless double-beta decay, the diffuse supernova neutrinos, and neutrinos
from nearby supernova. As a potential near-term target, we propose a
measurement of muon and gamma-ray fluxes in an accessible underground lunar
site such as the Mare Tranquillitatis Pit to perform a first measurement of the
prompt component in cosmic-ray-induced particle production, and to constrain
lunar evolution models.


### Study of large extra dimension and neutrino decay at P2SO experiment

**Abstract**: In this study, we examine two important new physics scenarios, \textit{i.e},
the theory of Large Extra Dimension (LED) and the theory of neutrino decay. We
study LED in the context of P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK with emphasis on P2SO, whereas
decay has been studied solely in the context of P2SO. For LED, in our study we
find that the combination of P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK can provide a better bound
than the current one only if all the oscillation parameters are measured with
absolute certainty. However, for decay, one can obtain a better bound with P2SO
as compared to ESSnuSB and MOMENT, but the bound obtained by P2SO is weak as
compared to DUNE and T2HK. Regarding sensitivities to the current unknowns, if
LED exists in nature, its impact on mass ordering, octant, and CP violation is
very mild; however, decay can alter the sensitivities related to CP violation
and octant in a non-trivial way.

**Abstract**: White matter alterations are increasingly implicated in neurological diseases
and their progression. International-scale studies use diffusion-weighted
magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to qualitatively identify changes in white
matter microstructure and connectivity. Yet, quantitative analysis of DW-MRI
data is hindered by inconsistencies stemming from varying acquisition
protocols. There is a pressing need to harmonize the preprocessing of DW-MRI
datasets to ensure the derivation of robust quantitative diffusion metrics
across acquisitions. In the MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn challenge, participants
were provided raw data from the same individuals collected on the same scanner
but with two different acquisitions and tasked with preprocessing the DW-MRI to
minimize acquisition differences while retaining biological variation.
Submissions are evaluated on the reproducibility and comparability of
cross-acquisition bundle-wise microstructure measures, bundle shape features,
and connectomics. The key innovations of the QuantConn challenge are that (1)
we assess bundles and tractography in the context of harmonization for the
first time, (2) we assess connectomics in the context of harmonization for the
first time, and (3) we have 10x additional subjects over prior harmonization
challenge, MUSHAC and 100x over SuperMUDI. We find that bundle surface area,
fractional anisotropy, connectome assortativity, betweenness centrality, edge
count, modularity, nodal strength, and participation coefficient measures are
most biased by acquisition and that machine learning voxel-wise correction,
RISH mapping, and NeSH methods effectively reduce these biases. In addition,
microstructure measures AD, MD, RD, bundle length, connectome density,
efficiency, and path length are least biased by these acquisition differences.

**Abstract**: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance in generative tasks, but this comes at the expense of sampling
efficiency. To enhance sampling speed without sacrificing quality, various
distillation-based accelerated sampling algorithms have been recently proposed.
However, they typically require significant additional training costs and model
parameter storage, which limit their practical application. In this work, we
propose PCA-based Adaptive Search (PAS), which optimizes existing solvers for
DPMs with minimal learnable parameters and training costs. Specifically, we
first employ PCA to obtain a few orthogonal unit basis vectors to span the
high-dimensional sampling space, which enables us to learn just a set of
coordinates to correct the sampling direction; furthermore, based on the
observation that the cumulative truncation error exhibits an ``S''-shape, we
design an adaptive search strategy that further enhances the sampling
efficiency and reduces the number of stored parameters to approximately 10.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAS can significantly enhance existing
fast solvers in a plug-and-play manner with negligible costs. For instance, on
CIFAR10, PAS requires only 12 parameters and less than 1 minute of training on
a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to optimize the DDIM from 15.69 FID (NFE=10) to 4.37.


### Golden Noise for Diffusion Models: A Learning Framework

**Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes
personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.
While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve
better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still
lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn
golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in
this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt},
which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a
small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the
concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that
systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt
for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline
and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains
100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts.
With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise
prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise
into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as
a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored
to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the
impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality
of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL,
DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and
efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited
additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden
noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.
