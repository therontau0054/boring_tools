**Abstract**: In this work, we explore the effect of neutrino nonstandard interactions
(NSI) involving the charm quark at SND@LHC. Using an effective description of
new physics in terms of four-fermion operators involving a charm quark, we
constrain the Wilson coefficients of the effective interaction from two and
three-body charmed meson decays. In our fit, we include charmed meson decays
not only to pseudoscalar final states but also to vector final states and
include decays to the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ final states. We also consider
constraints from charmed baryon decays. We then study the effect of new physics
in neutrino scattering processes, involving charm production at SND@LHC, for
various benchmark new physics couplings obtained from the low energy fits.
Finally, we also study the effects of lepton universality violation (LUV)
assuming that the new physics coupling is not lepton universal.

**Abstract**: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact
distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of
disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons
(VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of
laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly
the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to
image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture
capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band
RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100
MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a
distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF
pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by
the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses
synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV
pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes
the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band
continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10
$\mu$A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a
compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton
scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical"
footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual
micro-bunches per RF pulse enables > 10 nC of charge to be produced in a
macrobunch of < 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class
prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.

**Authors**: Christopher Gutiérrez, Asari G. Prado

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-02

**PDF Url**: [2412.18332v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18332v2)

**Abstract**: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and
easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of
two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices.
Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms
is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for
tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist
angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides
time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users
to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of
PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and
then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with
variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems,
and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$,
Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms
can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics
courses.

**PDF Url**: [2406.13615v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13615v3)

**Abstract**: We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field
on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate
configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from
Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced
oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field,
reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that
the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron
gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new
theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the
first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the
experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the
quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the
electrons.


### A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology
**Authors**: Michael Bleher

**Published Date**: 2024-12-17

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-02

**PDF Url**: [2412.13285v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13285v2)

**Abstract**: This article reviews Witten's gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology
from the perspective of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer theory. Expanding on
Witten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer
homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are
expected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to
the original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the
solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton
solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the
five-dimensional cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s \times W^4$. The relation to knot
invariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3
\times \mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \subset X^3 \times \{0\}$ embedded in
its three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold
require the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological
invariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various
dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a
comprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to
well-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the
$\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and
twisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on
the elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole
boundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of
Haydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an
equality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3
\times \mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.


### Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics
**Authors**: Andrew Gracyk

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-02

**PDF Url**: [2410.10137v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10137v4)

**Abstract**: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for
PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we
refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the
VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow,
embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space
developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which
the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our
choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the
traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of
prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing
term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative,
and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach,
allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can
be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric
singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps
ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a
canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods
focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations
for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest,
our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes
better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed
architecture, frequently reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) error between 15%
to 35% on select datasets. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose
solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical
justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics
with VAEs.

**PDF Url**: [2501.01338v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01338v1)

**Abstract**: At the Large Hadron Collider, the vast amount of data from experiments
demands not only sophisticated algorithms but also substantial computational
power for efficient processing. This paper introduces hardware acceleration as
an essential advancement for high-energy physics data analysis, focusing
specifically on the application of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to bridge the gap
between complex software algorithms and their hardware implementation. We will
explore how HLS facilitates the direct implementation of software algorithms
into hardware platforms such as FPGAs, enhancing processing speeds and enabling
real-time data analysis. This will be highlighted through the case study of a
track-finding algorithm for muon reconstruction with the CMS experiment,
demonstrating HLS's role in translating computational tasks into high-speed,
low-latency hardware solutions for particle detection and reconstruction. Key
techniques in HLS, including parallel processing, pipelining, and memory
optimization, will be discussed, illustrating how they contribute to the
efficient acceleration of algorithms in high-energy physics. We will also cover
design methodologies and iterative processes in HLS to optimize performance and
resource utilization, alongside a brief mention of additional techniques like
algorithm approximation and hardware / software co-design. In short, this paper
will underscore the potential of hardware acceleration in high-energy physics
research, emphasizing HLS as a powerful tool for physicists to enhance
computational efficiency and foster groundbreaking discoveries.


### Commutative Evolution Laws in Holographic Cellular Automata: AdS/CFT, Near-Extremal D3-Branes, and a Deep Learning Approach
**Authors**: Hyunju Go

**PDF Url**: [2012.06441v8](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06441v8)

**Abstract**: According to 't Hooft, restoring Poincar\'e invariance in a holographic
cellular automaton (CA) requires two distinct evolution laws that commute. We
explore how this is realized in the AdS/CFT framework, assuming commutativity
as a fundamental principle--much like general covariance once did--for encoding
curvature. In our setup, physical processes in a given spacetime are encoded in
a CA; to preserve Poincar\'e symmetry, the spacetime curvature must effectively
vanish, so we consider a near-extremal black D3-brane solution, in which both
the stretched horizon and the conformal boundary are approximated by Minkowski
space. AdS/CFT implies a spatial evolution law connecting these hypersurfaces.
Commutativity means the final state does not depend on the order of time
evolution on each hypersurface and spatial evolution between them, forcing the
time evolution law on the horizon and boundary to coincide. To satisfy all
these conditions, we aim to demonstrate that the spatial evolution law
inevitably encapsulates the curvature of the bulk, including quantum effects.
For a computational model, we compactify the hyperplanes to tori, reducing the
degrees of freedom to a finite number; taking these tori to infinite size then
restores Poincar\'e symmetry. We propose a deep learning algorithm that, given
a known time evolution law and commutativity, deduces the corresponding spatial
evolution law.


### Gravitational waves from color restoration in a leptoquark model of radiative neutrino masses

**PDF Url**: [2501.01286v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01286v1)

**Abstract**: We study the first-order phase transitions and the emerging stochastic
gravitational wave spectrum in a minimal leptoquark extension of the Standard
Model that explains active neutrino oscillation data while satisfying current
flavor physics constraints. This model exhibits diverse phase transition
patterns, including color symmetry-breaking scenarios in the early Universe.
Strong correlations between model parameters and gravitational-wave signals
yield testable predictions for future experiments such as LISA, BBO, and
DECIGO. Specifically, a detectable signal in the mHz$\unicode{x2013}$0.1~Hz
frequency range features color-restoration and leptoquark masses near
$1.5~\mathrm{TeV}$. With this article, we also present the first application in
the literature of \texttt{Dratopi}. This is a soon-to-be-released tool for
phase transition analysis using the dimensional reduction formalism, that
interfaces the \texttt{DRalgo} package with \texttt{Python} and a slightly
modified version of \texttt{CosmoTransitions}.


### DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity
**Authors**: Wilfried Buchmuller, Arthur Hebecker, Alexander Westphal

**PDF Url**: [2412.09211v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09211v2)

**Abstract**: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an
intriguing model for cosmological "wave functions of the universe". Its
minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of
compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h > 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is
chosen to have positive values, $\phi > 0$, and interpreted as size of an
additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries
$h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is
generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the
behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been
obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a
boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with
Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on
the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to
expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however
be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also
illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.


## Diffusion
### Object-level Visual Prompts for Compositional Image Generation

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-02

**PDF Url**: [2501.01424v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01424v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a method for composing object-level visual prompts within a
text-to-image diffusion model. Our approach addresses the task of generating
semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to
the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in
this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input
visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different
images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention
mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual
representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck
for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder
that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from
these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual
prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and
composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional
guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness.
Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that
preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the
creative potential of text-to-image generation.


### Reconstruction vs. Generation: Taming Optimization Dilemma in Latent Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jingfeng Yao, Xinggang Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-01-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-02

**PDF Url**: [2501.01423v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01423v1)

**Abstract**: Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating
high-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in
this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in
visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially
larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable
generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for
sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information
loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive
computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent
difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address
this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation
models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision
foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the
reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster
convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces.
To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with
improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The
integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet
256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable
training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64
epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the
original DiT. Models and codes are available at:

### Text2Data: Low-Resource Data Generation with Textual Control

**PDF Url**: [2402.10941v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10941v2)

**Abstract**: Natural language serves as a common and straightforward signal for humans to
interact seamlessly with machines. Recognizing the importance of this
interface, the machine learning community is investing considerable effort in
generating data that is semantically coherent with textual instructions. While
strides have been made in text-to-data generation spanning image editing, audio
synthesis, video creation, and beyond, low-resource areas characterized by
expensive annotations or complex data structures, such as molecules, motion
dynamics, and time series, often lack textual labels. This deficiency impedes
supervised learning, thereby constraining the application of advanced
generative models for text-to-data tasks. In response to these challenges in
the low-resource scenario, we propose Text2Data, a novel approach that utilizes
unlabeled data to understand the underlying data distribution through an
unsupervised diffusion model. Subsequently, it undergoes controllable
finetuning via a novel constraint optimization-based learning objective that
ensures controllability and effectively counteracts catastrophic forgetting.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Data is able to achieve
enhanced performance regarding controllability across various modalities,
including molecules, motions and time series, when compared to existing
baselines.

**Abstract**: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a
movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of
interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative
control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more
repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative
aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage
model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of
the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a
diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically
and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed
by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is
achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as
cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our
model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In
addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking
The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated
characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our
demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.


### Generative Modelling with High-Order Langevin Dynamics
**Authors**: Ziqiang Shi, Rujie Liu

**Published Date**: 2024-04-19

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-02

**PDF Url**: [2404.12814v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12814v3)

**Abstract**: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data
generation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative
modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score
matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting
the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for
single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position,
velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data
generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude.
Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set
CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet
inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the
state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.
