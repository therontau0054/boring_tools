**Abstract**: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial
vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic
scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the
pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case,
we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical
PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral
condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the
massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a
primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten
coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical
$\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by
$O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic
expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that
the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}'
|_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral
limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction
that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like
topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our
results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in
synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can
uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.

**Abstract**: We study the number of propagating degrees of freedom, at non-linear order,
in torsion gravity theories, a class of modified theories of gravity that
include a propagating torsion in addition to the metric. We focus on a
three-parameter subfamily of theories (``torsion bigravity") that contains, at
linear order, only two physical excitations: a massless spin-2 one (with two
degrees of freedom) and a massive spin-2 one (with five degrees of freedom). We
study the dynamics of the massive spin-2 field in the limit where the torsion
field decouples from the metric. The number of degrees of freedom of the
torsion field is found to {\it change, at non-linear order, from five to nine}.

**Abstract**: Terahertz (THz) band has recently garnered significant attention due to its
exceptional capabilities in non-invasive, non-destructive sensing, and imaging
applications. However, current THz imaging systems encounter substantial
challenges owing to hardware limitations, which result in information loss and
restricted imaging throughput during data digitization and information
extraction processes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid
compressive optical-digital neural network designed to facilitate both
real-time THz imaging and precise object information extraction. This approach
utilizes a physical encoder, an optical neural network (ONN), to transform and
reduce the dimensionality of physical signals, effectively compressing them to
fit the physical constraints of THz sensor arrays. After the compressed signals
are captured and digitized by the THz sensor array, a jointly trained digital
neural network (DNN) reconstructs the signals into their desired or original
form. Our proposed THz ONN-DNN computational imaging system demonstrates
enhanced imaging quality, an expanded field of view with a lens-free system,
diffraction-free imaging capability, and real-time THz video capture at a rate
of two frames per second.

**Abstract**: We propose an approach to integrated optical spectral filtering that allows
arbitrary programmability, can compensate automatically for imperfections in
filter fabrication, allows multiple simultaneous and separately programmable
filter functions on the same input, and can configure itself automatically to
the problem of interest, for example to filter or reject multiple arbitrarily
chosen frequencies. The approach exploits splitting the input light into an
array of multiple waveguides of different lengths that then feed a programmable
interferometer array that can also self-configure. It can give spectral
response similar to arrayed waveguide gratings but offers many other filtering
functions, as well as supporting other structures based on non-redundant arrays
for precise spectral filtering. Simultaneous filtering also allows, for the
first time to our knowledge, an automatic measurement of the temporal coherency
matrix and physical separation into the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of
temporally partially coherent light fields.

**Abstract**: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe
nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle
colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via
the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this
mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for
overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's
laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This
structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems
coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show
how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using
strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within
the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous
quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To
illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a
quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1
dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter,
evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple
relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian,
measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of
mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.

**Abstract**: The possibility of a quantum system to exhibit properties that are akin to
both the classically held notions of being a particle and a wave, is one of the
most intriguing aspects of the quantum description of nature. These aspects
have been instrumental in understanding paradigmatic natural phenomena as well
as to provide nonclassical applications. A conceptual foundation for the wave
nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of
quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature
of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical system. We provide elements of a
resource theory of particleness, and give a quantification of the same.
Finally, we provide evidence for a complementarity between the particleness
thus introduced, and the coherence of an arbitrary quantum state.

**Abstract**: KM3NeT/ORCA is an underwater neutrino telescope under construction in the
Mediterranean Sea. Its primary scientific goal is to measure the atmospheric
neutrino oscillation parameters and to determine the neutrino mass ordering.
ORCA can constrain the oscillation parameters $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$ and
$\theta_{23}$ by reconstructing the arrival direction and energy of multi-GeV
neutrinos crossing the Earth. Searches for deviations from the Standard Model
of particle physics in the forward scattering of neutrinos inside Earth matter,
produced by Non-Standard Interactions, can be conducted by investigating
distortions of the standard oscillation pattern of neutrinos of all flavours.
This work reports on the results of the search for non-standard neutrino
interactions using the first six detection units of ORCA and 433 kton-years of
exposure. No significant deviation from standard interactions was found in a
sample of 5828 events reconstructed in the 1 GeV$-$1 TeV energy range. The
flavour structure of the non-standard coupling was constrained at 90\%
confidence level to be $|\varepsilon_{\mu\tau} | \leq 5.4 \times 10^{-3}$,
$|\varepsilon_{e\tau} | \leq 7.4 \times 10^{-2}$, $|\varepsilon_{e\mu} | \leq
5.6 \times 10^{-2}$ and $-0.015 \leq \varepsilon_{\tau\tau} -
\varepsilon_{\mu\mu} \leq 0.017$. The results are comparable to the current
most stringent limits placed on the parameters by other experiments.

**Abstract**: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic
stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars
under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state
spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars
under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and
rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead
spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric
bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution,
which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have
constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their
corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an
explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of
perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and
energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric
perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.

**Abstract**: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted
many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its
reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its
excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of
computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in
computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the
method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across
the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This
difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave
functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study
represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming
that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the
water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven
different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the
non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies
between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of
determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible
predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant
locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while
the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in
results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible
FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials
science, physics, chemistry, and biology.

**Abstract**: In this paper we define absorptive Compton amplitudes, which captures the
absorption factor for waves of spin-weight-$s$ scattering in black hole
perturbation theory. At the leading order, in the $G M \omega$ expansion, such
amplitudes are purely imaginary and expressible as contact terms. Equipped with
these amplitudes we compute the mass change in black hole scattering events via
Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, where the rest mass of Schwarzschild/Kerr
black hole is modified due to absorption of gravitational, electromagnetic, or
scalar fields sourced by other compact object. We reproduced the power loss
previously computed in the post-Newtonian expansion. The results presented here
hold for similar mass ratios and generic spin orientation, while keeping the
Kerr spin parameter to lie in the physical region $\chi \le 1$.

**Abstract**: Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in
security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides
theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial
perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for
randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making
predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small
perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a
significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical
methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the
diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent
space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent
representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points.
After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables
implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially
reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets
and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during
inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of
diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on
average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by
85$\times$ on average. Codes are available at:

### Orchid: Image Latent Diffusion for Joint Appearance and Geometry Generation
**Authors**: Akshay Krishnan, Xinchen Yan, Vincent Casser, Abhijit Kundu

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-22

**PDF Url**: [2501.13087v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13087v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art for image generation. Trained on large
datasets, they capture expressive image priors that have been used for tasks
like inpainting, depth, and (surface) normal prediction. However, these models
are typically trained for one specific task, e.g., a separate model for each of
color, depth, and normal prediction. Such models do not leverage the intrinsic
correlation between appearance and geometry, often leading to inconsistent
predictions.
  In this paper, we propose using a novel image diffusion prior that jointly
encodes appearance and geometry. We introduce a diffusion model Orchid,
comprising a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode color, depth, and surface
normals to a latent space, and a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for generating
these joint latents. Orchid directly generates photo-realistic color images,
relative depth, and surface normals from user-provided text, and can be used to
create image-aligned partial 3D scenes seamlessly. It can also perform
image-conditioned tasks like joint monocular depth and normal prediction and is
competitive in accuracy to state-of-the-art methods designed for those tasks
alone. Lastly, our model learns a joint prior that can be used zero-shot as a
regularizer for many inverse problems that entangle appearance and geometry.
For example, we demonstrate its effectiveness in color-depth-normal inpainting,
showcasing its applicability to problems in 3D generation from sparse views.


### An Efficient Framework for Crediting Data Contributors of Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, and their
performance is driven by training data, appraising the contribution of data
contributors is crucial to creating incentives for sharing quality data and to
implementing policies for data compensation. Depending on the use case, model
performance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution
learned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we
address the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to
data contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to
valuation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However,
estimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical
because it requires retraining on many training data subsets corresponding to
different contributors and rerunning inference. We introduce a method to
efficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by
leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method
with three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset,
(ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic
quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist
artworks. Our results empirically demonstrate that our framework can identify
important data contributors across models' global properties, outperforming
existing attribution methods for diffusion models.


### O(d/T) Convergence Theory for Diffusion Probabilistic Models under Minimal Assumptions

**PDF Url**: [2409.18959v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18959v2)

**Abstract**: Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse
a diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise,
have achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their
superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often
constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this
paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal
assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of
the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and
generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic
factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps.
This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment.
Moreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate
improves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data
distribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to
unknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image
distributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical
tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates
at each step of the reverse process.


### Low-dimensional adaptation of diffusion models: Convergence in total variation

**Abstract**: This paper investigates how diffusion generative models leverage (unknown)
low-dimensional structure to accelerate sampling. Focusing on two mainstream
samplers -- the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and the denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) -- and assuming accurate score estimates,
we prove that their iteration complexities are no greater than the order of
$k/\varepsilon$ (up to some log factor), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision
in total variation distance and $k$ is some intrinsic dimension of the target
distribution. Our results are applicable to a broad family of target
distributions without requiring smoothness or log-concavity assumptions.
Further, we develop a lower bound that suggests the (near) necessity of the
coefficients introduced by Ho et al.(2020) and Song et al.(2020) in
facilitating low-dimensional adaptation. Our findings provide the first
rigorous evidence for the adaptivity of the DDIM-type samplers to unknown
low-dimensional structure, and improve over the state-of-the-art DDPM theory
regarding total variation convergence.

**Abstract**: Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in
quantitative finance. Fourier methods leverage the regularity properties of the
integrand in the Fourier domain to accurately and rapidly value options that
typically lack regularity in the physical domain. However, most of the existing
Fourier approaches face hurdles in high-dimensional settings due to the tensor
product (TP) structure of the commonly employed numerical quadrature
techniques. To overcome this difficulty, this work advocates using the
randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier
methods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness
of the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing
practical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the
unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to
$[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at
the corners of the hypercube, and hence deteriorate the performance of RQMC. To
circumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation
procedure based on boundary growth conditions on the transformed integrand. The
proposed transformation preserves sufficient regularity of the original
integrand for fast convergence of the RQMC method. To validate our analysis, we
demonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation
to evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs,
and dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying
RQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain
for options with up to 15 assets.
