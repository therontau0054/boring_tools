**Abstract**: The study of $CP$ violation in hyperon transitions has a long history. In the early 2000s the HyperCP experiment made a major effort to seek $CP$-odd signals in the decay sequence $Ξ^-\toΛπ^-$ and $Λ\to pπ^-$, which motivated more searches. Most recently the BESIII and LHCb Collaborations have acquired or improved the upper bounds on $CP$ violation in a variety of hyperon nonleptonic processes, including $Σ^+\to nπ^+$ and $Σ^+\to pπ^0$. These measurements have not reached the standard-model level yet, but have stimulated a renewed interest in $CP$-violating new physics in strange-quark decay beyond what is constrained by the parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^\prime$ from the kaon sector. In this paper, after updating the standard-model expectations for $CP$-odd observables in the modes $Σ^\pm\to Nπ$, we revisit new-physics scenarios that could enhance the corresponding quantities in $Λ\to Nπ$ and $Ξ\toΛπ$ and apply them to the $Σ^\pm$ modes. We find that the $CP$ asymmetries in the latter can be significantly increased over the standard-model expectations, at levels which may be tested in the ongoing BESIII experiment and in future endeavors such as PANDA and the Super Tau Charm Facility.

**Abstract**: We present a complete characterization of diagonal unitary covariant (DU-covariant) superchannels, i.e. higher-order transformations transforming quantum channels into themselves. Necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity and trace preservation are derived and the canonical decomposition describing DU-covariant superchannels is provided. The presented framework unifies and extends known families of covariant quantum channels and enables explicit analysis of their action on physically relevant examples, including amplitude-damping, bit-flip, and Pauli channels. Our results provide a practical toolbox for symmetry-restricted higher-order quantum processes and offer a setting for exploring open problems such as the celebrated PPT$^2$ conjecture.

**Abstract**: The coil in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) determines the spatial shape of the electromagnetic field in the head, which structures are concurrently activated, and how focal stimulation is. Most of the readily available coils have been designed intuitively instead of systematic mathematical-physical optimization as there were no methods available at the time. Previous research however demonstrated that these coils are far from optimum, e.g., for pulse energy or efficiency, and leave substantial room for lots of improvements. Techniques for rigorous mathematical optimization have been developed but are only available to very few groups worldwide. This paper presents an open-source toolbox, COMATOSE, to change that situation and make these methods available to a wider community. It incorporates the fundamental formalisms and offers vector space decomposition as well as base mapping as an explicit forward method, which is computationally less demanding than iterative computational optimization but can also form the initial solution for a subsequent optimization run if desired.

**Abstract**: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.


### Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution

**Abstract**: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.

**PDF Url**: [2509.03838v3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03838v3)

**Abstract**: In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.

**Abstract**: In strongly correlated electronic systems, Coulomb interactions frequently manifest through emergent electronic orders that spontaneously break rotational symmetry. Understanding how such symmetry breaking intertwines with other collective phenomena -- such as unconventional superconductivity -- and how it shapes experimental observables, particularly transport responses, remains a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report a metallic phase with extreme transport anisotropy in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, with an anisotropy ratio rivaling that of quantum Hall stripe phases. At low temperature, a superconducting state emerges from this metallic phase. Strikingly, the superconductor not only inherits strong anisotropy but also exhibits a wide range of hysteretic transitions arising from the tunability of the underlying anisotropic order. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized coexistence between superconductivity and extreme transport anisotropy, shedding new light on the role of rotational symmetry breaking in shaping unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene.

**Abstract**: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to effectively harness quantum resources to surpass classical precision bounds. Although recent studies suggest that the indefinite causal order may enable sensitivities to attain the super-Heisenberg scaling, the physical origins of such enhancements remain elusive. Here, we introduce the nilpotency index $\mathcal{K}$, which quantifies the depth of non-commutativity between operators during the encoding process, can act as a fundamental parameter governing quantum-enhanced sensing. We show that a finite $\mathcal{K}$ yields an enhanced scaling of root-mean-square error as $N^{-(1+\mathcal{K})}$. Meanwhile, the requirement for indefinite causal order arises only when the nested commutators become constant. Remarkably, in the limit $\mathcal{K} \to \infty$, exponential precision scaling $N^{-1}e^{-N}$ is achievable. We propose experimentally feasible protocols implementing these mechanisms, providing a systematic pathway towards practical quantum-enhanced metrology.

**PDF Url**: [2504.13259v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13259v2)

**Abstract**: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $β$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $β$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.


### TauSpinner algorithms for including spin and New Physics effects in $\bar q q \rightarrow Z/γ^* \to ττ$ process
**Authors**: A. Yu. Korchin, E. Richter-Was, Z. Was

**PDF Url**: [2512.22971v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22971v2)

**Abstract**: The possible anomalous New Physics contributions to dipole and weak dipole moments of the $τ$ lepton bring renewed interest in development and revisiting charge-parity violating signatures in $τ$-pair production in $Z$-boson decay at energies of the LHC. In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to polarisation and spin correlations in the $\bar q q \to τ^+ τ^-$ production processes, with $τ$ decays included. Because of the complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighing with studied New Physics phenomena. Extensions of the Standard Model spin amplitudes, within Improved Born Approximation used for matrix element, are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with $τ$ dipole and weak dipole moments in mind, but is applicable to arbitrary New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into the Standard Model $2 \to 2$ structure of matrix element extensions. Implementation allows one also to introduce arbitrary phase-shift between vector and axial-vector couplings of $Z$ boson to $τ$ leptons, which would have impact on observed transverse spin correlations. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, together with distributions for spin correlation matrix. Numerical examples of impact on experimental signatures are shown in case of $τ^\pm \to ρ^\pm ν_τ\to π^\pm π^0 ν_τ$ decays. Information on how to use and configure the TauSpinner program is given in Appendix.

**Abstract**: Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.


### DIP: Dynamic In-Context Planner For Diffusion Language Models
**Authors**: Yang Li, Han Meng, Chenan Wang, Haipeng Chen

**PDF Url**: [2601.03199v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03199v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for general natural language tasks with in-context examples. However, due to the bidirectional attention mechanism, DLMs incur substantial computational cost as context length increases. This work addresses this issue with a key discovery: unlike the sequential generation in autoregressive language models (ARLMs), the diffusion generation paradigm in DLMs allows \textit{efficient dynamic adjustment of the context} during generation. Building on this insight, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{P}lanner (DIP), a context-optimization method that dynamically selects and inserts in-context examples during generation, rather than providing all examples in the prompt upfront. Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.


### Error analysis of a compositional score-based algorithm for simulation-based inference

**Abstract**: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become a widely used framework in applied sciences for estimating the parameters of stochastic models that best explain experimental observations. A central question in this setting is how to effectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter inference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in score-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a compositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within the diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of individual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of observations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained unexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the GAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its mean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number of observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example, where all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form.


### Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries
**Authors**: Ali Kashefi

**Published Date**: 2026-01-06

**Updated Date**: 2026-01-06

**PDF Url**: [2601.03030v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03030v1)

**Abstract**: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.


### LAMS-Edit: Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers for Improved Content Preservation in Diffusion-Based Image and Style Editing
**Authors**: Wingwa Fu, Takayuki Okatani

**Published Date**: 2026-01-06

**Updated Date**: 2026-01-06

**PDF Url**: [2601.02987v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02987v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-Image editing using diffusion models faces challenges in balancing content preservation with edit application and handling real-image editing. To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.

### The Recalibration Conundrum: Hedging Valuation Adjustment for Callable Claims
**Authors**: Cyril Bénézet, Stéphane Crépey, Dounia Essaket

**PDF Url**: [2304.02479v3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02479v3)

**Abstract**: The dynamic hedging theory only makes sense in the setup of one given model, whereas the practice of dynamic hedging is just the opposite, with models fleeing after the data through daily recalibration. This is quite of a quantitative finance paradox. In this paper we revisit Burnett (2021) \& Burnett and Williams (2021)'s notion of hedging valuation adjustment (HVA), originally intended to deal with dynamic hedging frictions, in the direction of recalibration and model risks. Specifically, we extend to callable assets the HVA model risk approach of B{é}n{é}zet and Cr{é}pey (2024). The classical way to deal with model risk is to reserve the differences between the valuations in reference models and in the local models used by traders. However, while traders' prices are thus corrected, their hedging strategies and their exercise decisions are still wrong, which necessitates a risk-adjusted reserve. We illustrate our approach on a stylized callable range accrual representative of huge amounts of structured products on the market. We show that a model risk reserve adjusted for the risk of wrong exercise decisions may largely exceed a basic reserve only accounting for valuation differences.


### Beyond P-Values: Importing Quantitative Finance's Risk and Regret Metrics for AI in Learning Health Systems
**Authors**: Richik Chakraborty

**Updated Date**: 2026-01-03

**PDF Url**: [2601.01116v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01116v1)

**Abstract**: The increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings challenges foundational assumptions underlying traditional frameworks of medical evidence. Classical statistical approaches, centered on randomized controlled trials, frequentist hypothesis testing, and static confidence intervals, were designed for fixed interventions evaluated under stable conditions. In contrast, AI-driven clinical systems learn continuously, adapt their behavior over time, and operate in non-stationary environments shaped by evolving populations, practices, and feedback effects. In such systems, clinical harm arises less from average error rates than from calibration drift, rare but severe failures, and the accumulation of suboptimal decisions over time.
  In this perspective, we argue that prevailing notions of statistical significance are insufficient for characterizing evidence and safety in learning health systems. Drawing on risk-theoretic concepts from quantitative finance and online decision theory, we propose reframing medical evidence for adaptive AI systems in terms of time-indexed calibration stability, bounded downside risk, and controlled cumulative regret. We emphasize that this approach does not replace randomized trials or causal inference, but complements them by addressing dimensions of risk and uncertainty that emerge only after deployment. This framework provides a principled mathematical language for evaluating AI-driven clinical systems under continual learning and offers implications for clinical practice, research design, and regulatory oversight.
