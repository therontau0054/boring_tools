**Abstract**: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable
parts.

**Abstract**: We employ a procedure that enables us to calculate the excess free energies
for a finite Ising cylinder with domain walls analytically. This procedure
transparently covers all possible configurations of the domain walls under
given boundary conditions and allows for a physical interpretation in terms of
coarse-grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. The resulting
integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract
them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this
end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features.
For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of
systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is
necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the
complex plane.

**Abstract**: Nonlinear optics is crucial for shaping the spatial structure of shortwave
light and its interactions with matter, but achieving this through simple
harmonic generation with a single pump is challenging. This study demonstrates
nonlinear spin-orbit conversion using spin-dependent pump shaping via geometric
phase, allowing the direct creation of desired structured harmonic waves from a
Gaussian pump beam. By using the liquid-crystal flat optical elements
fabricated with photoalignment, we experimentally produce higher-order
cylindrically vectorial modes in second harmonic fields. We examine the
vectorial spatial wavefunctions, their propagation invariance, and nonlinear
spin-orbit conversion. Our results provide an efficient method for full
structuring nonlinear light in broader harmonic systems, with significant
applications in laser micromachining and high-energy physics.

**Abstract**: Accurate atomic physics reference data are a crucial requirement for analysis
and interpretation of observed spectra, even more so for observations with high
spectral resolution. This document provides a curated list of atomic physics
references frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy,
outside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own
underlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical
constants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes
of neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used
notation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies
in H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence
lines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and
He-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider
currently the best available reference energies, which are considered high
accuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory
measurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in
the chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these
lines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic
data for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions,
and the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of
empirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The
table for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the
energy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve
as a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted
overview tables. When making use of the information found in these papers,
credit should be given to their original authors by citing the appropriate
references.


### Time Derivatives of Weak Values
**Authors**: Xavier Oriols

**PDF Url**: [2409.01460v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01460v3)

**Abstract**: The time derivative of a physical property often gives rise to another
meaningful property. Since weak values provide empirical insights that cannot
be derived from expectation values, this paper explores what physical
properties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It
demonstrates that, in general, the time derivative of a gauge-invariant weak
value is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant quantity. Two conditions
are presented to ensure that the left- or right-time derivative of a weak value
is also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under these conditions, a local
Ehrenfest-like theorem can be derived for weak values giving a natural
interpretation for the time derivative of weak values. Notably, a single
measured weak value of the system's position provides information about two
additional unmeasured weak values: the system's local velocity and
acceleration, through the first- and second-order time derivatives of the
initial weak value, respectively. These findings also offer guidelines for
experimentalists to translate the weak value theory into practical laboratory
setups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies. An example
illustrates how the electromagnetic field can be determined at specific
positions and times from the first- and second-order time derivatives of a weak
value of position.


### A unified neural background-error covariance model for midlatitude and tropical atmospheric data assimilation
**Authors**: Boštjan Melinc, Uroš Perkan, Žiga Zaplotnik

**Published Date**: 2025-06-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.11968v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11968v2)

**Abstract**: Estimating background-error covariances remains a core challenge in
variational data assimilation (DA). Operational systems typically approximate
these covariances by transformations that separate geostrophically balanced
components from unbalanced inertio-gravity modes - an approach well-suited for
the midlatitudes but less applicable in the tropics, where different physical
balances prevail. This study estimates background-error covariances in a
reduced-dimension latent space learned by a neural-network autoencoder (AE).
The AE was trained using 40 years of ERA5 reanalysis data, enabling it to
capture flow-dependent atmospheric balances from a diverse set of weather
states.
  We demonstrate that performing DA in the latent space yields analysis
increments that preserve multivariate horizontal and vertical physical balances
in both tropical and midlatitude atmosphere. Assimilating a single 500 hPa
geopotential height observation in the midlatitudes produces increments
consistent with geostrophic and thermal wind balance, while assimilating a
total column water vapor observation with a positive departure in the
nearly-saturated tropical atmosphere generates an increment resembling the
tropical response to (latent) heat-induced perturbations. The resulting
increments are localized and flow-dependent, and shaped by orography and
land-sea contrasts. Forecasts initialized from these analyses exhibit realistic
weather evolution, including the excitation of an eastward-propagating Kelvin
wave in the tropics.
  Finally, we explore the transition from using synthetic ensembles and a
climatology-based background error covariance matrix to an operational ensemble
of data assimilations. Despite significant compression-induced variance loss in
some variables, latent-space assimilation produces balanced, flow-dependent
increments - highlighting its potential for ensemble-based latent-space 4D-Var.

**Published Date**: 2024-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2412.03639v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03639v2)

**Abstract**: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean
wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded
as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model,
the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on
the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns
negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values
for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate
various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with
current observational bounds.

**Abstract**: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that quantum mechanics is
incomplete based on the assumption that local actions cannot influence elements
of reality at a distant location (local realism). In this work, using a
recently defined quantum reality quantifier, we show that Alice's local quantum
operations can be correlated with the erasure of the reality of observables in
Bob's causally disconnected laboratory. To this end, we implement a modified
optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's and Bob's measurements
remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of photons and quantum
state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with the total absence of
any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum operation applied by
Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a spatial element of
reality of Bob's photon. Our results reveal that Bob's photon can entangle two
extra non-interacting degrees of freedom, thus confirming that Bob's photon
path is not an element of physical reality.


### PCG-Informed Neural Solvers for High-Resolution Homogenization of Periodic Microstructures
**Authors**: Yu Xing, Yang Liu, Lipeng Chen, Huiping Tang, Lin Lu

**Published Date**: 2025-06-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.17087v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17087v1)

**Abstract**: The mechanical properties of periodic microstructures are pivotal in various
engineering applications. Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for
predicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex
microstructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional
numerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive,
especially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing
learning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and
generalization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present
CGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for
solving homogenization problems. CGINS leverages sparse and periodic 3D
convolution to enable high-resolution learning while ensuring structural
periodicity. It features a multi-level network architecture that facilitates
effective learning across different scales and employs minimum potential energy
as label-free loss functions for self-supervised learning. The integrated
preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides
PCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy.
Additionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical
consistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on
Dirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies
and material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative
error below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and
GPU-accelerated numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers 2 times to 10 times
speedups over traditional methods while maintaining physically reliable
predictions at resolutions up to $512^3$.


### Al-Khwarizmi: Discovering Physical Laws with Foundation Models
**Authors**: Christopher E. Mower, Haitham Bou-Ammar

**Published Date**: 2025-02-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2502.01702v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01702v2)

**Abstract**: Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and
engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences,
biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep
networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting
interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of
Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building
such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with
L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions.
However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires
significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This
work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law
discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy.
Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach
automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively
refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two
steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw
data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature
libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws
correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent
increase against the best-performing alternative.

### DreamCube: 3D Panorama Generation via Multi-plane Synchronization
**Authors**: Yukun Huang, Yanning Zhou, Jianan Wang, Kaiyi Huang, Xihui Liu

**Published Date**: 2025-06-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.17206v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17206v1)

**Abstract**: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands
high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated
omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from
pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic
data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D
scene generation.


### Deep generative models as the probability transformation functions
**Authors**: Vitalii Bondar, Vira Babenko, Roman Trembovetskyi, Yurii Korobeinyk, Viktoriya Dzyuba

**Published Date**: 2025-06-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.17171v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17171v1)

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.


### A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pacal Poupart

**Published Date**: 2025-05-23

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.12036v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12036v2)

**Abstract**: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image
diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However,
existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full
sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference
datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden
noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield
superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that
leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a
prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory
storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive
experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently
improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most
significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps
increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.
These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis
and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion
models.


### MeDi: Metadata-Guided Diffusion Models for Mitigating Biases in Tumor Classification
**Authors**: David Jacob Drexlin, Jonas Dippel, Julius Hense, Niklas Prenißl, Grégoire Montavon, Frederick Klauschen, Klaus-Robert Müller

**Published Date**: 2025-06-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.17140v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17140v1)

**Abstract**: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.


### Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Michael Plainer, Hao Wu, Leon Klein, Stephan Günnemann, Frank Noé

**Published Date**: 2025-06-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-20

**PDF Url**: [2506.17139v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17139v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.
