**Abstract**: We introduce ShadowDraw, a framework that transforms ordinary 3D objects into shadow-drawing compositional art. Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling.

**Abstract**: Real-world physical processes do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact and low-variability subsets of functional space. This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems.
  This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown.
  We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals.
  Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations.

**Authors**: Mahindra Singh Rautela, Alexander Most, Siddharth Mansingh, Bradley C. Love, Ayan Biswas, Diane Oyen, Earl Lawrence

**PDF Url**: [2509.21670v3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21670v3)

**Abstract**: We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.

**Abstract**: Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $μ_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.


### A Theory of Backgrounds and Background Independence
**Authors**: Marc Klinger

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2512.05043v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05043v1)

**Abstract**: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.

**Abstract**: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying γ-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.


### Isolating chirality-breaking SMEFT operators with Drell-Yan angular analysis
**Authors**: Samuele Grossi, Xu Li, Lorenzo Rolla, Riccardo Torre

**Published Date**: 2025-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2512.05018v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05018v1)

**Abstract**: We present a comprehensive strategy to isolate the effect of a class of chirality-breaking interactions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) by exploiting Drell-Yan angular analysis and the violation of the Lam-Tung relation. Unlike most SMEFT interpretation of Drell-Yan measurements, dominated by growing-with-energy effects generated by the interference of SMEFT-induced and SM amplitudes, this method isolates operators that contribute only quadratically in the Wilson coefficients, allowing for an independent probe of non-interfering operators. Denoting with $v$ the electroweak vev, with $\sqrt{s}$ the center-of-mass energy, and with $Λ$ the scale of new physics, the non-interfering contributions to the amplitude generated by the chirality-breaking operators can be proportional to $v\sqrt{s}/Λ^{2}$ or $s/Λ^{2}$. We argue that these two classes can be further distinguished by analyzing the angular observables of the lepton pair in the transverse momentum and in the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair. We therefore present an analysis of the lepton-pair angular observables in both these distributions. Based on a precise estimate of the Standard Model contribution to the relevant observables for the $pp\to l^{+}l^{-}+X$ process up to $O(α_{S}^{2})$, we present realistic projections for the sensitivity of the LHC with $300$ fb$^{-1}$ and for the HL-LHC with $3$ ab$^{-1}$ to chirality-breaking interactions, demonstrating that angular observables provide an independent and clean handle on SMEFT effects, especially in regions where the Standard Model contribution is naturally suppressed thanks to the Lam-Tung relation. This analysis becomes crucial to go beyond single parameter global fits, since it helps breaking degeneracies with chirality preserving operators and to disentangle overlapping directions in the EFT parameter space.


### Reflection Removal through Efficient Adaptation of Diffusion Transformers

**Published Date**: 2025-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2512.05000v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05000v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a diffusion-transformer (DiT) framework for single-image reflection removal that leverages the generalization strengths of foundation diffusion models in the restoration setting. Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2512.04997v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04997v1)

**Abstract**: Algorithmic formulations of GPU programs provide a high-level alternative to device-specific code by expressing computations as compositions of well-defined parallel primitives (e.g., map, sort, reduce), rather than through handcrafted GPU kernels. In this work, we demonstrate that this paradigm can be extended to complex and challenging problems in computational physics: the simulation of granular flows and fluid-particle interactions.
  LEDDS, our open-source framework, performs fully coupled Lattice Boltzmann -- Discrete Element Method (LBM-DEM) simulations using only algorithmic primitives, and runs efficiently on single-GPU platforms. The entire workflow, including neighbor search, collision detection, and fluid-particle coupling, is expressed as a sequence of portable primitives. While the current implementation illustrates these principles primarily through algorithms from the C++ Standard Library, with selective use of Thrust primitives for performance, the underlying concept is compatible with any HPC environment offering a rich set of parallel algorithms and is therefore applicable across a wide range of modern GPU systems and future accelerators.
  LEDDS is validated through benchmarks spanning both DEM and LBM-DEM configurations, including sphere and ellipsoid collisions, wall friction tests, single-particle settling, Jeffery's orbits, and particle-laden shear flows. Despite its high level of abstraction, LEDDS achieves performances comparable to those of hand-tuned CUDA solvers, while maintaining portability and code clarity. These results show that high-performance LBM-DEM coupling can be achieved without sacrificing generality or readability, establishing LEDDS as a blueprint for portable multiphysics frameworks based on algorithmic primitives.


### Introduction to quantum control: From basic concepts to applications in quantum technologies
**Authors**: Christiane P. Koch

**Published Date**: 2025-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2512.04990v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04990v1)

**Abstract**: Quantum control refers to our ability to manipulate quantum systems. This tutorial-style chapter focuses on the use of classical electromagnetic fields to steer the system dynamics. In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits. The chapter concludes with an outlook on integrating coherent control with engineered dissipation and a discussion of open questions in the field.

### Value Gradient Guidance for Flow Matching Alignment
**Authors**: Zhen Liu, Tim Z. Xiao, Carles Domingo-Enrich, Weiyang Liu, Dinghuai Zhang

**PDF Url**: [2512.05116v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05116v1)

**Abstract**: While methods exist for aligning flow matching models--a popular and effective class of generative models--with human preferences, existing approaches fail to achieve both adaptation efficiency and probabilistically sound prior preservation. In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment.


### NeuralRemaster: Phase-Preserving Diffusion for Structure-Aligned Generation
**Authors**: Yu Zeng, Charles Ochoa, Mingyuan Zhou, Vishal M. Patel, Vitor Guizilini, Rowan McAllister

**Published Date**: 2025-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2512.05106v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05106v1)

**Abstract**: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation. Videos, additional examples, and code are available on our \href{https://yuzeng-at-tri.github.io/ppd-page/}{project page}.


### Foundations of Diffusion Models in General State Spaces: A Self-Contained Introduction

**Abstract**: Although diffusion models now occupy a central place in generative modeling, introductory treatments commonly assume Euclidean data and seldom clarify their connection to discrete-state analogues. This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.

**PDF Url**: [2512.05070v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05070v1)

**Abstract**: Simulating the conditioned dynamics of diffusion processes, given their initial and terminal states, is an important but challenging problem in the sciences. The difficulty is particularly pronounced for rare events, for which the unconditioned dynamics rarely reach the terminal state. In this work, we leverage a self-consistency property of the conditioned dynamics to learn the diffusion bridge in an iterative online manner, and demonstrate promising empirical results in a range of settings.


### Towards a unified framework for guided diffusion models

**PDF Url**: [2512.04985v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04985v1)

**Abstract**: Guided or controlled data generation with diffusion models\blfootnote{Partial preliminary results of this work appeared in International Conference on Machine Learning 2025 \citep{li2025provable}.} has become a cornerstone of modern generative modeling. Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings.

### Idea-Gated Transformers: Enforcing Semantic Coherence via Differentiable Vocabulary Pruning
**Authors**: Darshan Fofadiya

**Published Date**: 2025-12-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-12-03

**PDF Url**: [2512.03343v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03343v1)

**Abstract**: Autoregressive Language Models (LLMs) trained on Next-Token Prediction (NTP) often suffer from ``Topic Drift'' where the generation wanders away from the initial prompt due to a reliance on local associations rather than global planning \citep{holtzman2019curious}. While scaling model size mitigates this \citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.


### The First Crypto President: Presidential Power and Cryptocurrency Markets During Trump's Second Term (2025-2029)
**Authors**: Habib Badawi

**PDF Url**: [2512.03189v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03189v1)

**Abstract**: This paper analyzes the intersection of presidential authority and cryptocurrency markets during Donald J. Trump's second term (2025-2029). We examine developments from 2024 through October 2025, focusing on how executive influence, family business ventures, and digital assets became intertwined in ways that blurred boundaries between public office and private profit. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative market data with qualitative institutional assessment, we identify politically linked digital assets as a distinct class characterized by reflexive valuations, asymmetric risk distribution, and systemic vulnerabilities. The Trump family's integrated cryptocurrency ecosystem reached peak valuations exceeding eleven billion dollars before collapsing by more than one trillion in market capitalization following a tariff announcement in October 2025. Results highlight conflicts of interest, failures in market microstructure, and the emergence of political finance as a monetizable phenomenon in the digital age. The study contributes to understanding how presidential signaling reshapes capital flows, how politically branded tokens function as quasi-currencies, and how sudden policy actions can trigger cascading liquidations across global digital asset systems.
