**Abstract**: Recent advancements in behavior cloning have enabled robots to perform
complex manipulation tasks. However, accurately assessing training performance
remains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior
cloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently,
researchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and
time-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal
policies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address
these issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that
incorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout
the entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and
deployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical
world, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted
from the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by
rendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state
information from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies
can be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly
parallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the
simulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints,
effectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating
traditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT
manipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates
obtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations. Videos of our system can

**Abstract**: Recent experimental results from the Atomki collaboration have reported the
observation of anomalous effects in Beryllium, Helium and Carbon nuclear
transitions that could hint at physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the
MEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the
Beryllium transition ${^8}\text{Be}^\star\to{^8}\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of
this result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations
of the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$
with mass around $17\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of
a spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was
initially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous
signal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the
SINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon
anomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.

**Abstract**: Quantum no-cloning is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum
information. In this work, we introduce a new toolkit for analyzing cloning
games; these games capture more quantitative versions of no-cloning and are
central to unclonable cryptography. Previous works rely on the framework laid
out by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski and Wehner to analyze both the $n$-qubit
BB84 game and the subspace coset game. Their constructions and analysis face
the following inherent limitations:
  - The existing bounds on the values of these games are at least $2^{-0.25n}$;
on the other hand, the trivial adversarial strategy wins with probability
$2^{-n}$. Not only that, the BB84 game does in fact admit a highly nontrivial
winning strategy. This raises the natural question: are there cloning games
which admit no non-trivial winning strategies?
  - The existing constructions are not multi-copy secure; the BB84 game is not
even $2 \mapsto 3$ secure, and the subspace coset game is not $t \mapsto t+1$
secure for a polynomially large $t$. Moreover, we provide evidence that the
existing technical tools do not suffice to prove multi-copy security of even
completely different constructions. This raises the natural question: can we
design new cloning games that achieve multi-copy security, possibly by
developing a new analytic toolkit?
  We study a new cloning game based on binary phase states and show that it is
$t$-copy secure when $t=o(n/\log n)$. Moreover, for constant $t$, we obtain the
first asymptotically optimal bounds of $O(2^{-n})$. We also show a worst-case
to average-case reduction for a large class of cloning games, which allows us
to show the same quantitative results for Haar cloning games. These technical
ingredients together enable two new applications which have previously been out
of reach; one in black hole physics, and one in unclonable cryptography.


### Microcavity-Enhanced Exciton Dynamics in Light-Harvesting Complexes: Insights from Redfield Theory
**Authors**: Ilmari Rosenkampff, TÃµnu Pullerits

**PDF Url**: [2504.02066v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02066v2)

**Abstract**: We investigated the exciton transfer dynamics in photosynthetic
light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2) coupled to an optical microcavity. Using
computational simulations based on Redfield theory, we analyzed how microcavity
coupling influences energy relaxation and transfer within and between LH2
aggregates. Our results show that the exciton transfer rate between B850 rings
follows a square dependence on the light-matter coupling strength, in agreement
with Fermi's golden rule. Interestingly, the energy transfer rate remains
almost independent of the number of LH2 complexes. This behavior is explained
by the molecular components of the polaritonic wavefunction overlaps. These
findings highlight the crucial role of cavity-induced polaritonic states in
mediating energy transport and provide a theoretical framework for optimizing
microcavity environments to enhance exciton mobility in light-harvesting
systems and related photonic applications.

**Abstract**: Explicit examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence where both bulk and boundary
theories are tractable are hard to come by, but the minimal tension string on
$AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ is one notable example. In this paper, we discuss
how one can construct sigma models on twistor space, with a particular focus on
applying these techniques to the aforementioned string theory. We derive novel
incidence relations, which allow us to understand to what extent the minimal
tension string encodes information about the bulk. We identify vertex operators
in terms of bulk twistor variables and a map from twistor space to spacetime is
presented. We also demonstrate the presence of a partially broken global
supersymmetry algebra in the minimal tension string and we argue that this
implies that there exists an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ formulation of the theory. The
implications of this are studied and we demonstrate the presence of an
additional constraint on physical states.

**Abstract**: The rarefied flow and multi-scale flow are crucial for the aerodynamic design
of spacecraft, ultra-low orbital vehicles and plumes. By introducing a discrete
velocity space, the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods can
capture complex and non-equilibrium distribution functions and describe flow
behaviors exactly. The unified methods predict flows from continuum to rarefied
regimes by adopting unified modeling, and they can be further applied to other
multi-scale physics such as radiation heat transfer, phonon heat transfer and
plasma. In the flow field, the concrete dynamic process needs to describe the
gas-gas interaction and gas-surface interaction (GSI). However, in both DVM and
unified methods, only a simple but not accurate GSI is used, which can be
regarded as a Maxwell GSI with a fixed accommodation coefficient of 1 (full
accommodation) at the present stage. To overcome the bottleneck in extending
DVM and unified methods to the numerical experiment and investigate real
multi-scale flow physics, this paper realizes precise GSI in the DVM framework
by constructing the boundary conditions of a concrete Maxwell GSI with an
adjustable accommodation coefficient. In the constructing process, the problems
of macro-conservation and micro-consistency in the DVS at the boundary are well
solved by reflected macroscopic flux and interpolation distribution function
and interpolation error correction, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that
the multi-scale flows in the background of aeronautics and aerospace are often
at supersonic and hypersonic speeds, the unstructured velocity space (UVS) is
essential. From the perspective of generality, the GSI is forced on UVS.
Besides, by combined with the unified method (the unified gas-kinetic scheme in
the paper), the effectiveness and validity of the present GSI on the DVM
framework are verified by a series of simulations.


### A novel Cercignani-Lampis boundary model for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows

**PDF Url**: [2406.09636v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09636v4)

**Abstract**: To extend the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods to more
realistic boundary conditions, a Cercignani-Lampis (CL) boundary with different
momentum and thermal energy accommodations is proposed and integrated into the
DVM framework. By giving the macroscopic flux from the numerical quadrature of
the incident molecular distribution, the reflected macroscopic flux can be
obtained for the given accommodation coefficients. Then, an anisotropic
Gaussian distribution can be found for the reflected molecules, whose
parameters are determined by the calculated reflected macroscopic flux. These
macroscopic flux and microscopic Gaussian distribution form a complete physical
process for the reflected molecules. Furthermore, the CL boundary is integrated
into the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), making it suitable for the
simulation of both monatomic and diatomic gas flows, and it accommodates both
the conventional Cartesian velocity space and the recently developed efficient
unstructured velocity space. Moreover, this new GSI boundary is suitable for
both explicit and implicit schemes, offering better performance for flow
prediction. Finally, the performance of the new boundary is validated through a
series of numerical tests covering a wide range of Knudsen and Mach numbers.


### IR finite correlation functions in de Sitter space, a smooth massless limit, and an autonomous equation
**Authors**: Alexander Kamenshchik, Polina Petriakova

**Published Date**: 2024-10-21

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-04

**PDF Url**: [2410.16226v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16226v3)

**Abstract**: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar
field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By
employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation
function up to the $\lambda^3$ order and the four-point correlation function up
to the $\lambda^2$ one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar
field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the
vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but
results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part.
Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive
scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known
two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one.
Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field
coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear
physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the
Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach,
and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a
renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point
correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the
non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant
$\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the
two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of
Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless
parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} < \infty$.

**Abstract**: Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems,
ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic
decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always
straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the
system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the
false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we
measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay
mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits
ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate
scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the
instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to
study out-of-equilibrium field theories.

**Abstract**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems
in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods
dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their
accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic
training (DT), a method designed to enhance model performance over extended MD
simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the
challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster
anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy
compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent
design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials,
making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.

### Diffusion Active Learning: Towards Data-Driven Experimental Design in Computed Tomography

**PDF Url**: [2504.03491v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03491v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce Diffusion Active Learning, a novel approach that combines
generative diffusion modeling with data-driven sequential experimental design
to adaptively acquire data for inverse problems. Although broadly applicable,
we focus on scientific computed tomography (CT) for experimental validation,
where structured prior datasets are available, and reducing data requirements
directly translates to shorter measurement times and lower X-ray doses. We
first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model on domain-specific CT
reconstructions. The diffusion model acts as a learned prior that is
data-dependent and captures the structure of the underlying data distribution,
which is then used in two ways: It drives the active learning process and also
improves the quality of the reconstructions. During the active learning loop,
we employ a variant of diffusion posterior sampling to generate conditional
data samples from the posterior distribution, ensuring consistency with the
current measurements. Using these samples, we quantify the uncertainty in the
current estimate to select the most informative next measurement. Our results
show substantial reductions in data acquisition requirements, corresponding to
lower X-ray doses, while simultaneously improving image reconstruction quality
across multiple real-world tomography datasets.


### BUFF: Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Single Image Super-Resolution

**Abstract**: Super-resolution (SR) techniques are critical for enhancing image quality,
particularly in scenarios where high-resolution imagery is essential yet
limited by hardware constraints. Existing diffusion models for SR have relied
predominantly on Gaussian models for noise generation, which often fall short
when dealing with the complex and variable texture inherent in natural scenes.
To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Bayesian Uncertainty Guided
Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BUFF). BUFF distinguishes itself by
incorporating a Bayesian network to generate high-resolution uncertainty masks.
These masks guide the diffusion process, allowing for the adjustment of noise
intensity in a manner that is both context-aware and adaptive. This novel
approach not only enhances the fidelity of super-resolved images to their
original high-resolution counterparts but also significantly mitigates
artifacts and blurring in areas characterized by complex textures and fine
details. The model demonstrates exceptional robustness against complex noise
patterns and showcases superior adaptability in handling textures and edges
within images. Empirical evidence, supported by visual results, illustrates the
model's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios, and its effectiveness
in addressing common SR issues such as blurring. Experimental evaluations
conducted on the DIV2K dataset reveal that BUFF achieves a notable improvement,
with a +0.61 increase compared to baseline in SSIM on BSD100, surpassing
traditional diffusion approaches by an average additional +0.20dB PSNR gain.
These findings underscore the potential of Bayesian methods in enhancing
diffusion processes for SR, paving the way for future advancements in the
field.


### Conditioning Diffusions Using Malliavin Calculus

**PDF Url**: [2504.03461v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03461v1)

**Abstract**: In stochastic optimal control and conditional generative modelling, a central
computational task is to modify a reference diffusion process to maximise a
given terminal-time reward. Most existing methods require this reward to be
differentiable, using gradients to steer the diffusion towards favourable
outcomes. However, in many practical settings, like diffusion bridges, the
reward is singular, taking an infinite value if the target is hit and zero
otherwise. We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and
path-space integration by parts, that enables the development of methods robust
to such singular rewards. This allows our approach to handle a broad range of
applications, including classification, diffusion bridges, and conditioning
without the need for artificial observational noise. We demonstrate that our
approach offers stable and reliable training, outperforming existing
techniques.


### End-to-end Learning of Sparse Interventions on Activations to Steer Generation

**Abstract**: The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient
mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or
provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms
should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output
quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by
intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting
distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a
source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap,
these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not
accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions
that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work
linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a
global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layerwise distributional
shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be
regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron
and layer selection. Empirically, LinEAS only requires a handful of samples to
be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation, while
performing on par with far more involved finetuning approaches. We show that
LinEAS interventions can be composed, study the impact of sparsity on their
performance, and showcase applications in text-to-image diffusions.


### Minority-Focused Text-to-Image Generation via Prompt Optimization
**Authors**: Soobin Um, Jong Chul Ye

**Published Date**: 2024-10-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-04

**PDF Url**: [2410.07838v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07838v3)

**Abstract**: We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context
of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of
text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications
of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI.
Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on
high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like
CFG) that are essential for high-quality generation. To address this, we
present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion
models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework
that encourages emergence of desired properties during inference while
preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor
this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes
generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood
objective. Extensive experiments conducted across various types of T2I models
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce
high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers. Code is
available at https://github.com/soobin-um/MinorityPrompt.
