**Abstract**: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

**Abstract**: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically
contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in
physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in
non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we
derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic
plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the
flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft
mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave
backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is
treated perturbatively.

**PDF Url**: [2404.12931v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12931v2)

**Abstract**: We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria
based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike
other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and
unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a
lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two
different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the
dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the
detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly
related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective
for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials,
and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton
splittings.

**Abstract**: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a crucial platform for quantum
technologies, where its precise numerical modeling is indispensable for the
continued advancement of the field. We present here a Python library for
simulating the NV spin dynamics under general experimental conditions, i.e. a
digital twin. Our library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other
environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time evolution,
resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum observable given by
fluorescence. The simulation framework is based on a non-perturbative
time-dependent Hamiltonian model, where the states initialization and readout
are postulated from the interaction with optical fields. By eliminating
oversimplifications such as the adoption of rotating frames for the microwave
and radio frequency fields, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics emerging
from realistic pulse constraints. The software is illustrated with three
examples and validated by comparing the simulations with experimental reports,
relevant to the fields of quantum computing (conditional logic gates), sensing
(dynamical decoupling sequences with coupled spins) and networks (state
teleportation). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust numerical modeling
of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, which can be
used for a wide range of applications.

**Abstract**: Observing superdiffusive scaling in the spin transport of the integrable 1D
Heisenberg model is one of the key discoveries in non-equilibrium quantum
many-body physics. Despite this remarkable theoretical development and the
subsequent experimental observation of the phenomena in KCuF$_3$, real
materials are often imperfect and contain integrability breaking interactions.
Understanding the effect of such terms on the superdiffusion is crucial in
identifying connections to such materials. Current quantum hardware has already
ascertained its utility in studying such non-equilibrium phenomena by
simulating the superdiffusion of the 1D Heisenberg model. In this work, we
perform a quantum simulation of the superdiffusion breakdown by generalizing
the superdiffusive Floquet-type 1D Heisenberg model to a general 2D model. We
comprehensively study the effect of different 2D interactions on the
superdiffusion breakdown by tuning up their strength from zero, corresponding
to the 1D Heisenberg chain, to finite nonzero values. We observe that certain
2D interactions are more resilient against superdiffusion breakdown than others
and that the $SU(2)$ preserving 2D interaction has the highest resilience among
all the 2D interactions we study. Importantly, this observed resilience has
direct implications for sustaining superdiffusive spin transport in
two-dimensional lattices. We reason out the relative resilience against the
superdiffusion breakdown through an analysis of the scattering coefficients off
the 2D interaction in otherwise 1D chains. The relative resilience of different
interaction types against superdiffusion breakdown was also captured in quantum
hardware with remarkable accuracy, further establishing the current quantum
hardware's applicability in simulating interesting non-equilibrium quantum
many-body phenomena.


### Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates
**Authors**: Andrew Comech, Niranjana Kulkarni, Nabile Boussaïd, Jesús Cuevas-Maraver

**Published Date**: 2024-12-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2501.04027v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04027v3)

**Abstract**: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the
Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model,
generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach
to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that
indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We
show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that
stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The
approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves
in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.

**Abstract**: LLM-based autonomous agents have recently shown strong capabilities in
solving complex industrial design tasks. However, in domains aiming for carbon
neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted
design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability,
scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we
introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that
automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems
with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based
methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively
acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface.
This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization
components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs.
The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual
explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental
results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared
to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over
33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's
superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to
transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.

**Abstract**: We present the first physical realization of in-pixel signal processing with
integrated AI-based data filtering for particle tracking detectors. Building on
prior work that demonstrated a physics-motivated edge-AI algorithm suitable for
ASIC implementation, this work marks a significant milestone toward intelligent
silicon trackers. Our prototype readout chip performs real-time data reduction
at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and
latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been
shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This
development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI,
with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in
high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.


### Measurement of the tau anomalous magnetic moment using Ultra-peripheral collisions with the ALICE detector in Run 3 Pb-Pb data
**Authors**: Roman Lavička, Paul Alois Bühler

**PDF Url**: [2510.12661v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12661v1)

**Abstract**: The anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton ($a_{\tau}$) is a sensitive
probe for the search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions and
thus for new physics. This study investigates the feasibility of measuring
$a_{\tau}$ using ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at the LHC, where
photon-photon interactions ($\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$) produce tau
lepton pairs. We focus on events recorded by the ALICE detector during Run 3
Pb-Pb data-taking. Events are selected in the decay channel where one tau
decays into an electron and neutrinos, and the other decays into a charged
pion, or three charged pions, and neutrinos. These samples are enhanced with
decays into muons, which are inseparable in the ALICE detector. The clean
environment of UPCs minimizes hadronic background, while the advanced particle
identification capabilities of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and
Time-of-Flight (TOF) systems allow for efficient separation of electrons,
pions, and background particles. In this talk, prospects for measuring this
process by ALICE in Run 3, which benefits from high statistics and improved
systematics uncertainties, will be discussed. Results will provide tighter
constraints on $a_{\tau}$, contributing to the broader effort to test the
Standard Model's robustness and explore physics beyond it.

**PDF Url**: [2510.12796v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12796v1)

**Abstract**: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.


### UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation
**Authors**: Kevin Li, Manuel Brack, Sudeep Katakol, Hareesh Ravi, Ajinkya Kale

**Published Date**: 2025-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2510.12789v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12789v1)

**Abstract**: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

**Abstract**: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.


### DiffEM: Learning from Corrupted Data with Diffusion Models via Expectation Maximization

**PDF Url**: [2510.12691v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12691v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

**Abstract**: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

### TabAttackBench: A Benchmark for Adversarial Attacks on Tabular Data
**Authors**: Zhipeng He, Chun Ouyang, Lijie Wen, Cong Liu, Catarina Moreira

**Published Date**: 2025-05-27

**PDF Url**: [2505.21027v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21027v2)

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models by
inducing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to input
data. While these attacks are well studied in unstructured domains such as
images, their behaviour on tabular data remains underexplored due to mixed
feature types and complex inter-feature dependencies. This study introduces a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates adversarial attacks on tabular datasets
with respect to both effectiveness and imperceptibility. We assess five
white-box attack algorithms (FGSM, BIM, PGD, DeepFool, and C\&W) across four
representative models (LR, MLP, TabTransformer and FT-Transformer) using eleven
datasets spanning finance, energy, and healthcare domains. The benchmark
employs four quantitative imperceptibility metrics (proximity, sparsity,
deviation, and sensitivity) to characterise perturbation realism. The analysis
quantifies the trade-off between these two aspects and reveals consistent
differences between attack types, with $\ell_\infty$-based attacks achieving
higher success but lower subtlety, and $\ell_2$-based attacks offering more
realistic perturbations. The benchmark findings offer actionable insights for
designing more imperceptible adversarial attacks, advancing the understanding
of adversarial vulnerability in tabular machine learning.

**Abstract**: Predicting stock returns remains a central challenge in quantitative finance,
transitioning from traditional statistical methods to contemporary deep
learning techniques. However, many current models struggle with effectively
capturing spatio-temporal dynamics and integrating multiple relational data
sources. This study proposes GrifFinNet, a Graph-Relation Integrated
Transformer for Financial Predictions, which combines multi-relational graph
modeling with Transformer-based temporal encoding. GrifFinNet constructs
inter-stock relation graphs based on industry sectors and institutional
ownership, and incorporates an adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically
integrate relational data in response to changing market conditions. This
approach enables the model to jointly capture spatial dependencies and temporal
patterns, offering a comprehensive representation of market dynamics. Extensive
experiments on two Chinese A-share indices show that GrifFinNet consistently
outperforms several baseline models and provides valuable, interpretable
insights into financial market behavior. The code and data are available at:
