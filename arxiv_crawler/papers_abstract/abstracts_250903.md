**Abstract**: We investigate the rich non-equilibrium physics arising in periodically
driven open quantum systems, specifically those realized within microcavity
resonators, whose dynamics are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hosting
Floquet Exceptional Points (FEPs). By introducing a periodically quenched
driving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and
determine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk
bands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs
can be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and
$\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding
numbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet
fidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the
momentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the
momentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of
FEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also
reveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like
dispersion around $\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin
effect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at
both edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet
engineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with
significant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale.

**Abstract**: We perform a physics-informed Bayesian analyses of the equation of state of
hybrid neutron stars that incorporates color-flavor-locked quark matter modeled
by a three-flavor non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio framework with vector repulsion
and diquark pairing. Contrary to the model-agnostic Bayesian analyses our
scheme allows for distinguishing between the scenarios of neutron stars with
quark cores and without them. The used quark model realizes asymptotic
conformality at high densities in accordance with perturbative QCD. The
hadronic sector is described by the density-dependent relativistic functional
DD2Y-T, which satisfies chiral effective field theory constraints and includes
hyperonic degrees of freedom. We construct a large set of candidate hybrid EOSs
by varying the vector and diquark couplings and apply a Maxwell construction
for the quark-hadron phase transition. Observational constraints from recent
NICER pulsar mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability from GW170817 are
incorporated into the likelihood. Depending on whether the observational data
from the black widow pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the HESS J1731-347 object are
included to the analysis or not, the posterior distribution favors vector and
diquark couplings around $(\eta_V,\eta_D)\simeq (0.82,0.40)$ or
$(\eta_V,\eta_D)\simeq (0.64,0.36)$, respectively. This corresponds to
equations of state that support two-solar-mass neutron stars with
superconformal speed of sound and relatively low onset densities for
deconfinement. Our findings indicate that the most probable hybrid EOSs are
statistically preferred over the purely hadronic baseline. The corresponding
probabilities of agreeing with the observational data differ by one or two
orders of magnitude depending on the data set used. This suggests that quark
cores may exist in all observed neutron stars.

**Abstract**: The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation
networks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand
network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate
applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this
foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational
processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive
management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing
precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,
mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining
scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on
the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and
inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)
framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,
merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging
joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource
utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model
consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is
conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated
aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such
as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs
for corresponding task development.


### Federated learning over physical channels: adaptive algorithms with near-optimal guarantees
**Authors**: Rui Zhang, Wenlong Mou

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02538v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02538v1)

**Abstract**: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by
transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this
paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into
account both channel noise and hardware constraints. We establish theoretical
guarantees for the proposed algorithms, demonstrating convergence rates that
are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level. We also demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of our algorithms through simulation studies with deep
learning models.


### Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK
**Authors**: Jiuci Xu

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2403.09021v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09021v4)

**Abstract**: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and
characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite
temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally
entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting
the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the
observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord
operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits
features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra
is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the
tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further
show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra,
based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various
physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert
space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present
analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle
sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2501.07282v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07282v2)

**Abstract**: Given a countable discrete amenable group, we study conditions under which a
set map into a Banach space (or more generally, a complete semi-normed space)
can be realized as the ergodic sum of a vector under a group representation,
such that the realization is asymptotically indistinguishable from the original
map. We show that for uniformly bounded group representations, this property is
characterized by the class of bounded asymptotically additive set maps,
extending previous work for sequences in Banach spaces and on the case of a
single non-expansive linear map. Additionally, we develop a relative version of
this characterization, identifying when the additive realization can be chosen
within a prescribed target set. As an application, our results generalize
central aspects of thermodynamic formalism, bridging the additive and
asymptotically additive frameworks.


### Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in Robots
**Authors**: Minghuan Liu, Zhengbang Zhu, Xiaoshen Han, Peng Hu, Haotong Lin, Xinyao Li, Jingxiao Chen, Jiafeng Xu, Yichu Yang, Yunfeng Lin, Xinghang Li, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang, Tao Kong, Bingyi Kang

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02530v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02530v1)

**Abstract**: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.


### Quantum Pathways for Charged Track Finding in High-Energy Collisions
**Authors**: Christopher Brown, Michael Spannowsky, Alexander Tapper, Simon Williams, Ioannis Xiotidis

**Published Date**: 2023-11-01

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2311.00766v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00766v2)

**Abstract**: In high-energy particle collisions, charged track finding is a complex yet
crucial endeavour. We propose a quantum algorithm, specifically quantum
template matching, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of track finding.
Abstracting the Quantum Amplitude Amplification routine by introducing a data
register, and utilising a novel oracle construction, allows data to be parsed
to the circuit and matched with a hit-pattern template, without prior knowledge
of the input data. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by missing hit
data, demonstrating the ability of the quantum template matching algorithm to
successfully identify charged-particle tracks from hit patterns with missing
hits. Our findings therefore propose quantum methodologies tailored for
real-world applications and underline the potential of quantum computing in
collider physics.

**Authors**: James Ingoldby, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko, Simon Williams

**Published Date**: 2024-07-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2407.19022v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19022v2)

**Abstract**: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems,
offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field
Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for
simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation
(HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the
complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical
properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach
converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting
physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the
truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational
basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines,
reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As
a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited
to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number
of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running
simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical
predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum
hardware.


### HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction
**Authors**: Aishwarya Sarkar, Autrin Hakimi, Xiaoqiong Chen, Hai Huang, Chaoqun Lu, Ibrahim Demir, Ali Jannesari

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02481v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02481v1)

**Abstract**: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

## Diffusion
### Is RL fine-tuning harder than regression? A PDE learning approach for diffusion models
**Authors**: Wenlong Mou

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02528v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02528v1)

**Abstract**: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.


### Goal-Conditioned Data Augmentation for Offline Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Xingshuai Huang, Di Wu, Benoit Boulet

**Published Date**: 2024-12-29

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2412.20519v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20519v2)

**Abstract**: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from
pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the
environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally
fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address
datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce
Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned
diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging
recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel
return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based
guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution
representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with
selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited
optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated
conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the
capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark
and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to
demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across
various offline RL algorithms.


### RDIT: Residual-based Diffusion Implicit Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Chih-Yu Lai, Yu-Chien Ning, Duane S. Boning

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02341v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02341v1)

**Abstract**: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.


### Distribution estimation via Flow Matching with Lipschitz guarantees
**Authors**: Lea Kunkel

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02337v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02337v1)

**Abstract**: Flow Matching, a promising approach in generative modeling, has recently
gained popularity. Relying on ordinary differential equations, it offers a
simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, which are currently the
state-of-the-art. Despite its empirical success, the mathematical understanding
of its statistical power so far is very limited. This is largely due to the
sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant of the vector field
which drives the ODE. In this work, we study the assumptions that lead to
controlling this dependency. Based on these results, we derive a convergence
rate for the Wasserstein $1$ distance between the estimated distribution and
the target distribution which improves previous results in high dimensional
setting. This rate applies to certain classes of unbounded distributions and
particularly does not require $\log$-concavity.


### Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts
**Authors**: Taegyeong Lee, Jiwon Park, Kyunga Bang, Seunghyun Hwang, Ung-Jin Jang

**Published Date**: 2025-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-02

**PDF Url**: [2509.02308v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02308v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.


## Quantitative Finance
### Tabular Diffusion Counterfactual Explanations
**Authors**: Wei Zhang, Brian Barr, John Paisley

**Published Date**: 2025-08-31

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-31

**PDF Url**: [2509.00876v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00876v1)

**Abstract**: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.
