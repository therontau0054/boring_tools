**Abstract**: Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a
fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of
lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently
is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously
developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore
quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized
quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging
amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the
generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation
within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and
compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient
density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources
required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a
representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our
focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through
quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of
quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling
bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.

**Abstract**: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is
the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian
anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic
particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called
parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological
phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still
remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of
parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using
physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the
two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by
exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The
winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well
as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This
provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for
paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.

**PDF Url**: [2505.10531v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10531v1)

**Abstract**: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets
leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for
purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification
creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which
seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced
antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring Fermi surface nesting instabilities
in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the
magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally
inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart
from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities,
which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and
cold-atom systems.

**PDF Url**: [2505.10516v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10516v1)

**Abstract**: In pick-up experiments using nanodroplet and nanocluster beams, the size
distribution of hosts carrying a specified number of dopants changes when the
vapor density in the pick-up region is altered. This change, analyzed here, has
quantitative consequences for the interpretation of data that are sensitive to
host size, such as mass spectrometric, spectroscopic, and deflection
measurements.

**Abstract**: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling
distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to
handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration
of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important
effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking
amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning
approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used
to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from
data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with
neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical
systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear
vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for
nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily
accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the
network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic
data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained
to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are
presented.

**Abstract**: Strongly correlated and topological phases in moir\'e materials are
exquisitely sensitive to lattice geometry at both atomic and superlattice
length scales. Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice,
and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical
transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain.
Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced
elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge
factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional
metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a
Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic
origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from
fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a
versatile probe of correlated physics in a moir\'e material.

**Abstract**: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in
theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers.
These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently
simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on
a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian,
enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a
novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution.
Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state
energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins.
Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the
ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation
of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic
state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all
spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of
our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also
laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum
computers.


### Phenomenological study of semitauonic decays of $B$ and $B_s$ mesons to charm states
**Authors**: Sonali Patnaik, Lopamudra Nayak, Sanjay Kumar Swain

**PDF Url**: [2505.10491v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10491v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we compute the branching fraction of $B \to D^{(*)} \,\tau \,
\nu_{\tau}$ and $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\, \tau\, \nu_{\tau}$ within the Relativistic
Independent Quark Model, emphasizing the harmonic potential model-dependent
analysis of these decay channels in the precision flavor physics era.
Considering the experimental observation of longitudinal $\tau$-polarization
and fraction of longitudinal polarization ($F_L$) at LHCb and Belle, we have
also investigated these observables within our model framework which are
aligning well with the standard model expectations. We perform a comprehensive
analysis of the form factors across the whole accessible kinematic range of
$q^2$. Our results are consistent and agree well with other theoretical
approaches as well as with the experimental measurements. Furthermore, we
evaluated the clean ratios of $B_s$ to $B_0$ in the semimuonic mode that are in
accordance with the LHCb measurements, and support the validity of the SU(3)
flavor symmetry. Although the concept of new physics is facing a significant
challenge at the current TeV scale, semileptonic $B$ decays, nevertheless,
always serve as a valuable probe to study the decay dynamics.


### Characterizing quantum dynamics using multipartite entanglement generation

**Abstract**: Entanglement is a defining feature of many-body quantum systems and is an
essential requirement for quantum computing. It is therefore useful to study
physical processes which generate entanglement within a large system, as they
maybe replicated for applications involving the said requirements in quantum
information processing. A possible avenue to maximize entanglement generation
is to rely on the phenomena of information scrambling, i.e. transport of
initially localized information throughout the system. Here the rationale is
that the spread of information carries with it an inherent capacity of
entanglement generation. Scrambling greatly depends upon the dynamical nature
of the system Hamiltonian, and the interplay between entanglement generation
and information scrambling maybe investigated taking a chain of interacting
spins on a one dimensional lattice. This system is analogous to an array of
qubits and this relative simplicity implies that the resulting unitary dynamics
can be efficiently simulated using present-day cloud based NISQ devices. In our
present work, we consider such a spin model which is made up of nearest and
next nearest neighbor XXZ Model, along with an introduced coupling term lambda.
This coupling term serves as a tuning parameter which modifies the dynamical
nature of the system from the integrable to the quantum chaotic regime. In
order to quantify the entanglement generated within the system we use the more
general multipartite metric which computes the average entanglement across all
system bipartitions to obtain a global picture of the entanglement structure
within the entire system.


### Comparison of high-order moment models for the ion dynamics in a bounded low-temperature plasma

**Abstract**: Low-temperature plasmas often present non-equilibrium ion distribution
functions due to the collisions with the background gas and the presence of
strong electric fields. This non-equilibrium is beyond classical fluid models,
often requiring computationally-intensive kinetic simulations. In our work, we
study high-order moment models in order to capture the non-equilibrium state
with a macroscopic set of equations, which is more computationally efficient
than kinetic simulations. We compare numerical simulations of different moment
closures: Grad's closure, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM),
the extended quadrature method of moments, and a method based on entropy
maximization. We assess the different closures for plasma applications and
propose efficient numerical discretizations. The numerical solution of the
high-order moment models is compared to kinetic simulations of an argon plasma
between two floating walls at different pressure regimes, from nearly
collisionless to collisionally-dominated. In general, all the high-order moment
closures capture the ion transport with high fidelity as compared to the
kinetic simulations, providing an improvement as compared to classical fluid
models. Classical fluid closures such as the Fourier law for the heat flux is
shown to be not suitable to capture the sheath or the low pressure regime. In
addition, the ability of each moment method to reconstruct the velocity
distribution function from the moments is assessed. The high-order moment
models are able to capture the non-equilibrium distributions in the bulk and
sheath with remarkable fidelity, dramatically improving classical fluid models
while having comparable computational cost. In particular, the HyQMOM shows to
be a robust method that provides an excellent comparison with the kinetic
simulations of both the moments and the distribution function in the bulk and
the sheath.


## Diffusion
### Does Feasibility Matter? Understanding the Impact of Feasibility on Synthetic Training Data
**Authors**: Yiwen Liu, Jessica Bader, Jae Myung Kim

**Published Date**: 2025-05-15

**PDF Url**: [2505.10551v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10551v1)

**Abstract**: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.


### Pharmacophore-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Ligand-Based De Novo Drug Design
**Authors**: Amira Alakhdar, Barnabas Poczos, Newell Washburn

**PDF Url**: [2505.10545v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10545v1)

**Abstract**: Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy
challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural
or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for
capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a
biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a
pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation.
PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based
representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling
the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined
pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff
demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints
compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher
docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design,
without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore
modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and
flexible framework for rational drug design.


### Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps
**Authors**: Ningyuan Yang, Jiaxuan Gao, Feng Gao, Yi Wu, Chao Yu

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-15

**PDF Url**: [2505.10482v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10482v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as
robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills
from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the
sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion
policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.
While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising
solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to
effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This
challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood
estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated
optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized
policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much
lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies
(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework
that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.
By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned
on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and
gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments
demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when
training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency
and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot
control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results
show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the
Diffusion Policy.

**Abstract**: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate.
Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather
prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required.
Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation,
but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this
paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero
to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and
intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for
the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting
geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of
diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual
correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our
results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing
clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.
These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the
past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows
the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a
conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion
models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion
models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin
on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box
ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the
ensemble correlating well to the error.


### Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image
synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot
generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual
prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual
fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might
not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD
(Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system
designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD
models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents,
each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to
varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes
their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a
coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the
generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that
minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical
analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms
traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its
potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation
tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/YousIA/LGR_AD


## Quantitative Finance

**PDF Url**: [2505.10064v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10064v1)

**Abstract**: This research examines the empowerment of women entrepreneurs in the context
of entrepreneurial financing in France. It explores the factors that allow some
women entrepreneurs to access certain categories of external finance more
easily. The theoretical framework used is based on the concept of empowerment,
explored through its personal and relational dimensions. The study relies on a
quantitative approach, using data from a representative of women entrepreneurs.
The results show that the status of a founder affects access to external
finance in different ways: it increases the chances of successful fundraising,
but reduces the chances of obtaining bank finance. This finding highlights the
importance of empowerment dynamics, which vary according to the type of
financing. In addition, characteristics such as the presence of a spouse in the
business, high income, membership of a professional network and the diversity
of this network complete the analysis of inequalities in access. This study,
the first of its kind in France, suggests ways of enriching our understanding
of the diversity of situations experienced by female founders, thus helping to
deconstruct the homogeneous image of women's entrepreneurship.
