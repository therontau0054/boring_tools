**Abstract**: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter
distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with
DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at
the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency
with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts,
$z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where
$D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$
at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is
fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no
new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$
shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM
prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as
constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$
tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may
signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.

**Abstract**: We study the conservative dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general
effective theory of gravity which includes a metric and an arbitrary number of
scalar fields, through $\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$. Departures from Einstein gravity,
which preserve general coordinate and local Lorentz invariance, are
characterized by higher-derivative terms in a Lagrangian whose coupling
constants scale as powers of a ``new-physics'' length scale, $\ell$. For a
purely metric theory we compute the contributions from the the leading and
subleading higher-curvature curvature corrections. In four dimensions these are
cubic and quartic curvature terms, i.e. orders $\ell^4$ and $\ell^6$. We also
study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\ell^{4}$,
which includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical
Chern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings. Specifically, we compute the radial
action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop
order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact
objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital
observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping
post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement.

**Abstract**: The Large Hadron Collider, LHC, collides bunches of protons resulting in
multiple interactions that occur practically simultaneously. This creates a
pileup effect that distorts physics measurements due to the products of pileup
collisions. In order to improve the discovery potential of the LHC, it is
necessary to mitigate the effect of pileup interactions on the processes of
interest. In this paper, we suggest a novel AI-based method, PUMiNet, to tackle
the problem of pileup at the current LHC and future High Luminosity LHC
conditions. PUMiNet is an attention-based algorithm that mitigates pileup
effects using a regression task on jets in the context of an entire event. At
$\left\langle \mu \right\rangle=200$, PUMiNet is able to predict the hard
scatter energy and mass fractions of jets with $R^2=0.912$ and $R^2=0.720$,
respectively. These predictions enable the reconstruction of the Higgs boson
mass in the HL-LHC environment.

**Abstract**: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems
known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in
discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional
free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet
insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we
investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet
physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological
insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands
with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous
Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose
bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra
with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to
finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important
respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the
spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries
or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the
static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has
a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.


### Precision phenomenology of the PDF-BSM interplay

**Abstract**: The Standard Model (SM) is one of the most successful theories ever
conceived, representing a triumph of human intellect and collaboration. The SM
provides a very good description of visible matter, with the proton being a
central part of this understanding. The structure of the proton can be
parametrised in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), essential inputs
for theoretical predictions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which cannot be
computed from first principles and must be obtained from fits to experimental
data.
  Despite the remarkable success of the SM, many fundamental questions remain
unanswered, motivating the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
These searches often rely on precise comparisons between theoretical
predictions and experimental measurements. However, a significant challenge
arises because PDFs are typically determined under SM assumptions. This
approach can introduce potential biases and inconsistencies in BSM searches.
Additionally, signals of BSM physics may be absorbed by the PDFs during the
fitting procedure, further complicating the interpretation of the results.
  This PhD thesis explores the interplay between PDFs and BSM physics. We
introduce the open-source release of SIMUnet, a deep learning framework
designed to perform simultaneous fits of PDFs and BSM parameters, as well as to
assess the potential absorption of BSM signals by the PDFs. We study the
PDF-BSM interplay in the top sector and in a global dataset, and assess the
absorption of BSM physics in widely used models. Additionally, we explore how
BSM effects can alter the evolution of PDFs, and demonstrate the potential of
interpretable machine learning techniques in symbolic regression for collider
physics in general.


### Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory

**Abstract**: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain
insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body
dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy
collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on
current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined
mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a
particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple,
experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of
colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement
strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We
find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition
of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size
oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are
controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant
confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial
excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective
mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of
the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with
time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence
of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement
limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact
numerics.


### Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles
**Authors**: Nikolai G. Khlebtsov, Sergey V. Zarkov

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-04

**PDF Url**: [2503.02775v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02775v1)

**Abstract**: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least
two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting,
fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules, often embedded in a matrix
such as porous silica. To optimize the optical properties of such
bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical
ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods
requiring significant computer resources. Here, we present such type models
based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole
equivalence method (DEM). The MEM+DEM approach makes it possible to use the MEM
parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional
numerical calculations to build models for bilayered or multilayered
conjugates. Our analytical solutions depend on the particle shape, the shell
thickness, and the shell refractive index, regardless of the particle size and
the metal's nature. To illustrate the universality of our method, we calculate
extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs,
triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating
thickness from 0 to 30 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent
agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed
with COMSOL. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy of the MEM+DEM
analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various
plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and
metal-enhanced fluorescence.

**Abstract**: Context. Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical
environments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density,
momentum flux, and the total pressure. Modelling the dynamic interaction
between radiation and magnetized plasmas in such environments is an intricate
and computationally costly task. Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
the capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational
framework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated
magnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and
flux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are
combined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on
block-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results.
We introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative
MHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann
problems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall
the basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion
relation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation
fields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8
linear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three
wave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion
mode. Conclusions. The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform
multidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited
for larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation
interactions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.

**Abstract**: Accurate simulations of oil spill trajectories are essential for supporting
practitioners' response and mitigating environmental and socioeconomic impacts.
Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and
transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on
accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual
calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II
numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively
estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation
closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such
as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score
(FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed
oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that
occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over
12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach
systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control
simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in
consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods
of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in
dynamic environmental conditions.


### Influence of the chiral magnetic effect on particle-pair elliptic anisotropy
**Authors**: Han-Sheng Li, Yicheng Feng, Fuqiang Wang

**PDF Url**: [2404.05032v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05032v2)

**Abstract**: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is
separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance
in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive, azimuthal correlator difference
$\Delta\gamma$ between opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) charged hadron
pairs is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the
particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_2$). The CME signal, on the other hand,
contributes to the difference in the pair elliptic anisotropies between OS and
SS pairs ($\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$). We investigate $\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$ and
found its sensitivity to CME to be similar to that of the $\Delta\gamma$
observable.

### Reactive Diffusion Policy: Slow-Fast Visual-Tactile Policy Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation
**Authors**: Han Xue, Jieji Ren, Wendi Chen, Gu Zhang, Yuan Fang, Guoying Gu, Huazhe Xu, Cewu Lu

**PDF Url**: [2503.02881v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02881v1)

**Abstract**: Humans can accomplish complex contact-rich tasks using vision and touch, with
highly reactive capabilities such as quick adjustments to environmental changes
and adaptive control of contact forces; however, this remains challenging for
robots. Existing visual imitation learning (IL) approaches rely on action
chunking to model complex behaviors, which lacks the ability to respond
instantly to real-time tactile feedback during the chunk execution.
Furthermore, most teleoperation systems struggle to provide fine-grained
tactile / force feedback, which limits the range of tasks that can be
performed. To address these challenges, we introduce TactAR, a low-cost
teleoperation system that provides real-time tactile feedback through Augmented
Reality (AR), along with Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP), a novel slow-fast
visual-tactile imitation learning algorithm for learning contact-rich
manipulation skills. RDP employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) a slow latent
diffusion policy for predicting high-level action chunks in latent space at low
frequency, (2) a fast asymmetric tokenizer for closed-loop tactile feedback
control at high frequency. This design enables both complex trajectory modeling
and quick reactive behavior within a unified framework. Through extensive
evaluation across three challenging contact-rich tasks, RDP significantly
improves performance compared to state-of-the-art visual IL baselines through
rapid response to tactile / force feedback. Furthermore, experiments show that
RDP is applicable across different tactile / force sensors. Code and videos are
available on https://reactive-diffusion-policy.github.io/.


### Decentralized Adversarial Training over Graphs

**Abstract**: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been
attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus
on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work
studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected
to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that
interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that
are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the
coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed
learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for
multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial
training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning
strategies--diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of
the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex
environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.

**Abstract**: While score-based generative models are the model of choice across diverse
domains, there are limited tools available for controlling inference-time
behavior in a principled manner, e.g. for composing multiple pretrained models.
Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix
conditional and unconditional scores to approximately sample from conditional
distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate
distributions, necessitating additional 'corrector' steps. In this work, we
provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of
annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained
score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme which we call
Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by
carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential
equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve
sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by
proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing,
improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and
improving classifier-free guidance for text-to-image generation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/martaskrt/fkc-diffusion.


### EC-DIT: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Adaptive Expert-Choice Routing
**Authors**: Haotian Sun, Tao Lei, Bowen Zhang, Yanghao Li, Haoshuo Huang, Ruoming Pang, Bo Dai, Nan Du

**PDF Url**: [2410.02098v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02098v5)

**Abstract**: Diffusion transformers have been widely adopted for text-to-image synthesis.
While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the
effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and
challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image
generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models
(EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns
to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and
generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation
aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an
efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving
significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and
overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models.
Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior
scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual
importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment
evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of
71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive
interpretability.


### Spike-and-Slab Posterior Sampling in High Dimensions
**Authors**: Syamantak Kumar, Purnamrita Sarkar, Kevin Tian, Yusong Zhu

**Abstract**: Posterior sampling with the spike-and-slab prior [MB88], a popular multimodal
distribution used to model uncertainty in variable selection, is considered the
theoretical gold standard method for Bayesian sparse linear regression [CPS09,
Roc18]. However, designing provable algorithms for performing this sampling
task is notoriously challenging. Existing posterior samplers for Bayesian
sparse variable selection tasks either require strong assumptions about the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [YWJ16], only work when the measurement count grows
at least linearly in the dimension [MW24], or rely on heuristic approximations
to the posterior. We give the first provable algorithms for spike-and-slab
posterior sampling that apply for any SNR, and use a measurement count
sublinear in the problem dimension. Concretely, assume we are given a
measurement matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and noisy
observations $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\theta}^\star + \mathbf{\xi}$ of a
signal $\mathbf{\theta}^\star$ drawn from a spike-and-slab prior $\pi$ with a
Gaussian diffuse density and expected sparsity k, where $\mathbf{\xi} \sim
\mathcal{N}(\mathbb{0}_n, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}_n)$. We give a polynomial-time
high-accuracy sampler for the posterior $\pi(\cdot \mid \mathbf{X},
\mathbf{y})$, for any SNR $\sigma^{-1}$ > 0, as long as $n \geq k^3 \cdot
\text{polylog}(d)$ and $X$ is drawn from a matrix ensemble satisfying the
restricted isometry property. We further give a sampler that runs in
near-linear time $\approx nd$ in the same setting, as long as $n \geq k^5 \cdot
\text{polylog}(d)$. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we extend
our result to spike-and-slab posterior sampling with Laplace diffuse densities,
achieving similar guarantees when $\sigma = O(\frac{1}{k})$ is bounded.
