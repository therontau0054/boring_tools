**Abstract**: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

**Abstract**: We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin
of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL
parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We
conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in
the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less
significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at
the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with
a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized
approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This
framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and
reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter
space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.

**Abstract**: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

**Abstract**: One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the
Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel
Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical
perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area
of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current
experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana
zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic
property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal
encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a
crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in
the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated
localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength
enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the
qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to
the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant
quantum computation.

**Abstract**: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

**Abstract**: The charge-velocity-dependent one-scale model is an extension of the
canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model which explicitly incorporates
additional degrees of freedom on the string worldsheet, such as arbitrary
currents and charges, expected in physically realistic models. A previous paper
[Pimenta and Martins, Phys. Rev. D 110, 023540 (2024)] started an in-depth
classification of its possible asymptotic scaling solutions, with the goal of
identifying distinguishing features which may be tested against numerical
simulations or future observations. This earlier analysis restricted itself to
unbiased solutions; in the present one we relax this assumption, allowing for
the possibility of energy loss biases between the bare string and the
charge/current, or between the charge and the current themselves. We find
additional scaling solutions, some of which are parametric extensions of the
unbiased ones while others are new scaling branches which do not exist in the
unbiased case. Overall it remains the case that there are three broad classes
of solutions, mainly depending on the balance between the expansion rate and
the available energy loss mechanisms. Our results enable a quantitative
calibration of the model, using forthcoming high-resolution numerical
simulations.


### Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral

**Abstract**: Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet
seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert
space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating
physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral
model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative
effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over
topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest
frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how
it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular,
we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a
subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert
space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be
used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a
nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating
observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that
implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent
generalization of holography.

**PDF Url**: [2504.10279v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10279v2)

**Abstract**: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies
presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly
simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations
of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically
motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating
bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of
state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk
modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be
derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation,
resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new
insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in
the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a
maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key
properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and
gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids
and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space
mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.


### Possible consequences for physics of the negative resolution of Tsirelson's problem

**Abstract**: In 2020, Ji et al. [arXiv:2001.04383 and Comm.~ACM 64}, 131 (2021)] provided
a proof that the complexity classes $\text{MIP}^\ast$ and $\text{RE}$ are
equivalent. This result implies a negative resolution of Tsirelson's problem,
that is, $C_{qa}$ (the closure of the set of tensor product correlations) and
$C_{qc}$ (the set of commuting correlations) can be separated by a hyperplane
(that is, a Bell-like inequality). In particular, there are correlations
produced by commuting measurements (a finite number of them and with a finite
number of outcomes) on an infinite-dimensional quantum system which cannot be
approximated by sequences of finite-dimensional tensor product correlations.
Here, we point out that there are four logical possibilities of this result.
Each possibility is interesting because it fundamentally challenges the nature
of spacially separated systems in different ways. We list open problems for
making progress for deciding which of the possibilities is correct.


### NLO QCD effects on angular observables in $e^-p \to e^-(ν_e)Hj$ in presence of non-standard $HVV$ couplings

**Abstract**: The single Higgs production in neutral-current (NC) and charged-current (CC)
processes at an electron-proton ($ep$) collider is a useful channel to probe
new physics effects in the Higgs coupling to vector boson ($HVV$). In this
context, observables sensitive to non-standard couplings previously studied at
leading order require improved theoretical precision through the inclusion of
radiative corrections. In this work, we present a fully differential Higgs plus
one jet production at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD for both the
NC and CC processes. For the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC)
configuration, with a 60~GeV electron beam and a 7~TeV proton beam, the total
cross sections receive modest corrections with significantly reduced scale
uncertainties. We find that in several kinematic distributions which are
relevant to the analysis of $HVV$ couplings, the NLO K-factors are not flat.
Within the Standard Model, the polar angle of the electron (for NC) and the
azimuthal angular correlation (for both NC and CC processes) receive maximum
corrections in the range of 3-4\% in certain bins. We also compute NLO QCD
corrections in the presence of non-standard $HVV$ interactions. The corrections
in the azimuthal angular correlations are similar to the standard model
predictions. For the polar angle of the electron, the corrections are sensitive
to the nature of the $HVV$ coupling.

### SmoothSinger: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Singing Voice Synthesis with Multi-Resolution Architecture
**Authors**: Kehan Sui, Jinxu Xiang, Fang Jin

**Published Date**: 2025-06-26

**PDF Url**: [2506.21478v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21478v1)

**Abstract**: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.


### Flow-Based Single-Step Completion for Efficient and Expressive Policy Learning
**Authors**: Prajwal Koirala, Cody Fleming

**Published Date**: 2025-06-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-26

**PDF Url**: [2506.21427v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21427v1)

**Abstract**: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.


### Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application
**Authors**: Xiucheng Wang, Honggang Jia, Nan Cheng, Dusit Niyato

**Published Date**: 2025-06-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-26

**PDF Url**: [2506.05710v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05710v2)

**Abstract**: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness
against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A
theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address
distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align
received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on
this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic
communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for
semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for
denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports
zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and
out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for
future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality,
consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data
distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.


### Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation
**Authors**: Atharva Mehta, Shivam Chauhan, Monojit Choudhury

**Abstract**: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.
