**Abstract**: We present a compact scintillating fibre timing detector developed for the
Mu3e experiment. Mu3e is one of the flagship experiments of the Swiss particle
physics scene, aiming to search for the charged lepton flavour violating
(neutrinoless) muon decay $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$. Mu3e is planned to
start taking data in 2025 at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, using
the most intense continuous surface muon beam in the world (10$^8$ muons per
second).
  At the University of Geneva, together with partners from ETH Zurich, we are
developing a scintillating fibre detector formed by staggering three layers of
250 $\mu m$ diameter round scintillating fibres. The fibre ribbons are coupled
at both ends to multi-channel silicon photo-multiplier arrays, which are read
out with the MuTRiG ASIC, specifically developed for this experiment.
  This presentation is focused on the performances of the scintillating fibre
detector, notably on the time resolution around 250 ps, the efficiency greater
than 97\% and the spatial resolution of $\sim$ 100 $\mu m$. In this
presentation, we also include the challenges overcome to build this very thin
scintillating fibre detector, having a thickness smaller than 0.2\% of the
radiation length. Furthermore, we discuss the operation and performance of the
MuTRiG ASIC, used for reading out the 3072 channels of the fibre detector.

**Abstract**: The electron cooler of the CRYRING@ESR storage ring at the GSI-FAIR
accelerator complex is a unique instrument, which not only provides beam
cooling of the stored ions, but also serves as a low-energy electron target for
Dielectronic Recombination experiments. The minimisation of vacuum
contamination and the response to rapid energy changes are key requirements of
the cooler in electron target mode. Therefore, a test bench was prepared to
study the outgassing behaviour of the electron gun components and a setup was
constructed to evaluate the drift-electrode-modulation of the acceleration
voltage of the cooler. The vacuum studies showed that the electron gun cathode
was severely malfunctioning and resulted in its replacement. The
drift-electrode-modulation of the acceleration voltage showed significant
improvements compared to direct modulation of the terminal voltage of the
cooler.

**Abstract**: Space weather, driven by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs),
poses significant risks to technological systems. Accurately forecasting these
events and their impact on Earth's magnetosphere remains a challenge because of
the complexity of solar-terrestrial interactions. This study applied artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the chain of events associated with the May $2024$
superstorm, including solar flares from NOAA active region 13644,
Earth-directed CMEs, and a violent geomagnetic storm. Using magnetogram
cut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active
region morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the
occurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of
CME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind
measurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to
sound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed
unprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as
one minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in
predicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the
geomagnetic storm. These findings highlight the impressive potential of AI for
space weather forecasting and as a tool to mitigate the impact of extreme solar
events on critical infrastructure.


### How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-24

**PDF Url**: [2501.14681v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14681v1)

**Abstract**: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation
featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature
power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We
develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in
quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase.
At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped
oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which
power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the
peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if
the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the
dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and
comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also
test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them
with an intuitive mechanical analogy.

**Abstract**: Mu3e is an experiment currently under construction at the Paul Scherrer
Institute in Switzerland, designed to search for the Lepton Flavor Violating
(LFV) decay $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$. In extensions of the Standard Model
(SM) that account for neutrino masses, this decay is theoretically allowed but
occurs only through extremely rare loop processes, with a predicted branching
ratio of approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^{-54})$. Such a small probability
implies that any observation of this decay would provide clear evidence for
physics beyond the SM.
  The Mu3e experiment aims to probe the $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$ decay
with a sensitivity of approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})$ in its Phase-1 and
plans to achieve a sensitivity of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})$ after future
upgrades. To reach its Phase-1 ambitious goals, Mu3e is going to use the most
intense continuous muon beam in the world, generating 10$^{8}$ muon stops per
second in the target placed at the center of the Mu3e.
  Mu3e will use three main technologies for particle detection. The tracking
will done through ultra-thin (50 - 70 $\mu m$) pixel detectors based on MuPix11
sensors. These are high-voltage monolithic active pixel sensors (HV-MAPS) with
a $\sim$ 23~$\mu$m spatial resolution. The timing will be done through
scintillating fibres ($\sim$ 250 ps) and tiles ($\sim$ 40 ps), coupled to
silicon photomultipliers and read out by MuTRiG3 ASICs. A triggerless DAQ
system based on FPGAs will collect data from the detectors, which will then
undergo reconstruction in a GPU filter farm. The assembly of the detectors has
started, with a detector commissioning beam time planned for 2025. This
document reports on the status of the construction, installation, and
data-taking plans for the near future.

**Abstract**: Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has
become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale.
However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-{\AA}ngstr\"om probe
is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of
precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both
costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To
this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by
minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be
equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several
important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural
network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use
this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate
automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore
different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep
neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different
control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of
aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the
proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better
optical state with a higher convergence rate.


### Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials

**PDF Url**: [2412.09298v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09298v2)

**Abstract**: Symmetry is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics, fundamentally shaping
the behavior of electronic systems and inducing the emergence of novel
phenomena. The Hall effect, a key concept in this field, demonstrates how
symmetry breaking, particularly of time-reversal symmetry, influences
electronic transport properties. Recently, the nonlinear Hall effect has
extended this understanding by generating a transverse voltage that modulates
at twice the frequency of the driving alternating current without breaking
time-reversal symmetry. This effect is closely tied to the symmetry and quantum
geometric properties of materials, offering a new approach to probing the Berry
curvature and quantum metric. Here, we provide a review of the theoretical
insights and experimental advancements in the nonlinear Hall effect,
particularly focusing on its realization in two-dimensional materials. We
discuss the challenges still ahead, look at potential applications for devices,
and explore how these ideas might apply to other nonlinear transport phenomena.
By elucidating these aspects, this review aims to advance the understanding of
nonlinear transport effects and their broader implications for future
technologies.

**PDF Url**: [2501.14615v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14615v1)

**Abstract**: Calcium imaging has become a powerful alternative to electrophysiology for
studying neuronal activity, offering spatial resolution and the ability to
measure large populations of neurons in a minimally invasive manner. This
technique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and
medicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron
location and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs)
have facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering
latent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and
neuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference
algorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their
applicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a
novel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive
variational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons'
spatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for
spike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by
generating more informative and discriminative latent representations,
improving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of
neuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE
outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately
recover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using
realistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical
properties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between
different firing and connectivity types. These findings position the AVAE as a
versatile and powerful tool for advancing single-neuron analysis and lays the
groundwork for future integration of multimodal single-cell datasets in
neuroscience.


### Unmixing sub-leading Regge trajectories of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills
**Authors**: Julius Julius, Nika Sergeevna Sokolova

**Published Date**: 2024-09-11

**PDF Url**: [2409.07529v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07529v2)

**Abstract**: We study the conformal field theory data (CFT-data) of planar 4D $\mathcal{N}
= 4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory in the strong 't Hooft coupling limit. This regime
explores the physics of massive short strings in the flat-space limit of the
dual AdS. We focus on the CFT-data of the massive short strings exchanged in
the operator product expansion (OPE) of the four-point function dual to the
Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude. This CFT-data arranges itself into Regge
trajectories in the flat-space limit. Using inputs from recent advances in the
computation of the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude, integrability, and a
stipulation based on analyticity of the CFT-data in spin, we are able to fix
all the CFT-data on the four unique sub-leading Regge trajectories, at leading
non-trivial order, as a function of the string-mass level. One of our
predictions is that one of the four unique sub-leading Regge trajectories
decouples from the OPE in the flat-space limit. This hints at an emergent
selection rule in the flat-space limit, similar to our previous results in
arXiv:2310.06041. Our procedure should be applicable in a variety of similar
setups like for the AdS Veneziano amplitude or in ABJM.


### The standard no-signalling constraints in Bell scenarios are neither sufficient nor necessary for preventing superluminal signalling with general interventions
**Authors**: V. Vilasini, Roger Colbeck

**Published Date**: 2023-11-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-24

**PDF Url**: [2311.18465v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18465v2)

**Abstract**: Non-classical correlations resulting from entangled quantum systems have
sparked debates about the compatibility of quantum theory and relativity, and
about the right way to think about causation. Key to a causal theory is that
superluminal signalling is forbidden, which holds in quantum theory. In Bell
scenarios, relativistic causality principles like no superluminal signalling
are often assumed to follow from the standard no-signalling constraints on
correlations. We explore the connections between a range of relativistic
principles, including no superluminal signalling and no causal loops, and
constraints on correlations that can arise with arbitrary interventions, within
multi-party Bell scenarios. This includes standard no-signalling conditions and
proposed relaxations allowing phenomena like jamming, where it was suggested
that superluminal signalling and causal loops remain impossible. Using our
recent framework combining relativistic principles with causal modelling, we
show that any theory (classical or non-classical) allowing jamming must rely on
causal fine-tuning and superluminal causal influences. Additionally, we show
that jamming theories can lead to superluminal signalling in certain
situations, highlighting limitations for their physicality. However, we
identify cases where jamming correlations avoid superluminal signalling under
general interventions, demonstrating that standard no-signalling constraints
are not necessary for this purpose. We also show that these constraints are
insufficient to rule out superluminal signalling and are neither necessary nor
sufficient for ensuring no causal loops under general interventions. Finally,
we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for ruling out superluminal
signalling and operationally detectable causal loops, solidifying our
understanding of relativistic causality principles in information processing
tasks in space-time.


## Diffusion
### Controlling Moments with Kernel Stein Discrepancies
**Authors**: Heishiro Kanagawa, Alessandro Barp, Arthur Gretton, Lester Mackey

**Published Date**: 2022-11-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-24

**PDF Url**: [2211.05408v6](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05408v6)

**Abstract**: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) measure the quality of a distributional
approximation and can be computed even when the target density has an
intractable normalizing constant. Notable applications include the diagnosis of
approximate MCMC samplers and goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized
statistical models. The present work analyzes the convergence control
properties of KSDs. We first show that standard KSDs used for weak convergence
control fail to control moment convergence. To address this limitation, we next
provide sufficient conditions under which alternative diffusion KSDs control
both moment and weak convergence. As an immediate consequence we develop, for
each $q > 0$, the first KSDs known to exactly characterize $q$-Wasserstein
convergence.

**Abstract**: Text-to-image generation models can create high-quality images from input
prompts. However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of
identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this
problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional
modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their
applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model
configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of
language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through
context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context
consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent
text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story).
Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I
diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the
generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and
Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input
description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against
various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its
effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Code is
available at https://github.com/byliutao/1Prompt1Story.

**PDF Url**: [2501.14399v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14399v1)

**Abstract**: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences
across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the
multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant
challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet
Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at
advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The
model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation
encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt
message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise
encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to
capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated
multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information
through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order
interconnections between users and items.

**Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI
models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across
various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and
manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models
for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying
deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey,
we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the
fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of
classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further
categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and
hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological
innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data
modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data
analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research
directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability,
robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large
language models. The collection of DMAD research papers and resources is
available at https://github.com/fdjingliu/DMAD.


### TFG-Flow: Training-free Guidance in Multimodal Generative Flow

**Abstract**: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property
(e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples
with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly
efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes,
training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models.
However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many
scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to
as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and
general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where
guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce
TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow.
TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property
of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on
four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug
design by generating molecules with desired properties.
