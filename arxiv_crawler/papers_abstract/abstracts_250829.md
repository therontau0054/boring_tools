**Abstract**: Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important
constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated
Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems
is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the
Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible
with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we
furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their
distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are
described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize
the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH
systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic
response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH
Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.

**Abstract**: Proton decay experiments typically constrain baryon number violation to the
scale of grand unified theories. From a phenomenological point of view, this
makes direct probing of the associated new resonances, such as the X and Y
bosons, out of reach for even the most optimistic future experiments. It has,
however, been known that certain specific patterns of baryon and lepton number
violation can suppress proton decay by multiple powers of the masses of the
heavy resonances involved, opening the possibility that the observed limits on
the proton lifetime are consistent with baryon number violating physics at
energy scales much lower than that of grand unification. We construct an
explicit example of such a model which violates baryon number by one unit,
$\Delta \text{B} = -1$, and lepton number by three units, $\Delta \text{L} =
-3$, and show that despite stringent limits on the predicted $p \rightarrow
e^{+}/\mu^{+} \overline{\nu}\overline{\nu}$ mode from the Super-Kamiokande
experiment, the masses of the newly introduced elementary particles can be
$\mathcal{O}$(TeV). We identify interesting unique signatures of baryon number
violation of this model that can be probed both with currently available LHC
data and with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC. We also present a scenario for
low-scale baryogenesis within the framework of this model.

**Abstract**: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert
knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This
paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates
real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we
leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of
creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,
Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user
study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers
the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

**Abstract**: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree
graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in
non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct
strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such
that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with
coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then
introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these
satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably,
tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity
for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of
tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of
out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation
functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional
dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the
existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly
velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called
$\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in
non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates,
discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement
growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a
physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.

**Abstract**: Low gain avalanche diodes with DC- and AC-coupled readout were exposed to
ionizing and non-ionizing radiation at levels relevant to future experiments in
particle, nuclear, and medical physics and to astrophysics. Damage-related
change in their acceptor removal constants and in the resistivity of the region
between the guard ring and the active area are reported, as is change in the
leakage current and depletion voltages of the active volumes.

**Abstract**: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.


### Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles

**Abstract**: Self-organized turbulence represents a way for structuring in nature to arise
through sheer complexity rather than through linear instability theory.
Simulating ensembles of oscillators that undergo phase synchronization through
a propagating Kuramoto-interaction field, we present the spectral
characteristics of spontaneous, self-organized structures of locally coupled
oscillators. We demonstrate that the spectral density of emergent structures
can exhibit universal scaling laws, in line with expectations from nature,
indicating that observed statistical outcomes of complex physical interactions
can be achieved through a more general principle of self-organization. We
suggest that spontaneously generated structures may provide nuance to the
reigning reductionist explanations for the observed structure in coupled
systems of astrophysical and geophysical plasmas.


### Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees
**Authors**: Yaniv Hassidof, Tom Jurgenson, Kiril Solovey

**Abstract**: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

### Dark Forces Gathering

**PDF Url**: [2508.20999v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20999v1)

**Abstract**: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the
expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the
combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass.
Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the
change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing.
In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change
either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show
additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields.
However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and
polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark
sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the
evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise
to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a
range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional
signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard
Model physics.


### Radiation in Fluid/Gravity and the Flat Limit
**Authors**: Gabriel Arenas-Henriquez, Luca Ciambelli, Felipe Diaz, Weizhen Jia, David Rivera-Betancour

**PDF Url**: [2508.01446v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01446v2)

**Abstract**: We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting
gravitational radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a
well-defined flat limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the
boundary Cotton and stress tensor, which we collect into a radiative vector. We
reinterpret this vector holographically in terms of fluid variables in the dual
boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close
connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary
stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy
production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between
radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the
boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the
context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian
analogue of the radiative vector and introduce Celestial observables, such as
energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative structure.
Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian viscous stress
tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this framework. We
illustrate our results with explicit examples, including Robinson-Trautman
spacetimes and accelerating black holes.

### Dress&Dance: Dress up and Dance as You Like It - Technical Preview
**Authors**: Jun-Kun Chen, Aayush Bansal, Minh Phuoc Vo, Yu-Xiong Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-08-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2508.21070v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21070v1)

**Abstract**: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions
and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.


### Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation

**PDF Url**: [2508.21058v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21058v1)

**Abstract**: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

**Abstract**: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

### FFHFlow: Diverse and Uncertainty-Aware Dexterous Grasp Generation via Flow Variational Inference

**Abstract**: Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from
partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior
generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of
dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in
partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We
propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse,
robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty
in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based
deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming
the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational
Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of
flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and
identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To
further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with
the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that
prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and
success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its
practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven
sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page:

### Improving Fine-Grained Control via Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: While many diffusion models perform well when controlling particular aspects
such as style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained
control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design.
This paper introduces a novel training-free algorithm, independent of denoising
network architectures, for fine-grained generation, called Aggregation of
Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM). The algorithm integrates features from
multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate particular
features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that
AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating
its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially
focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages
improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for
tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional generation in diffusion
models. Specifically, it allows us to fully utilize existing or develop new
conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate
them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing
complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high
training costs. Code is available at: https://github.com/Hammour-steak/AMDM.


## Quantitative Finance

**Abstract**: Over the past decade, many dealers have implemented algorithmic models to
automatically respond to RFQs and manage flows originating from their
electronic platforms. In parallel, building on the foundational work of Ho and
Stoll, and later Avellaneda and Stoikov, the academic literature on market
making has expanded to address trade size distributions, client tiering,
complex price dynamics, alpha signals, and the internalization versus
externalization dilemma in markets with dealer-to-client and interdealer-broker
segments. In this paper, we tackle two critical dimensions: adverse selection,
arising from the presence of informed traders, and price reading, whereby the
market maker's own quotes inadvertently reveal the direction of their
inventory. These risks are well known to practitioners, who routinely face
informed flows and algorithms capable of extracting signals from quoting
behavior. Yet they have received limited attention in the quantitative finance
literature, beyond stylized toy models with limited actionability. Extending
the existing literature, we propose a tractable and implementable framework
that enables market makers to adjust their quotes with greater awareness of
informational risk.
