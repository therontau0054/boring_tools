**Abstract**: The strong longitudinal expansion characteristic of heavy-ion collisions
leads to universal attractor behavior of the resulting drop of quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) already at very early times. Assuming approximate boost invariance
and neglecting transverse expansion at the initial time, we incorporate
subsequent transverse dynamics of this system by linearizing the
Mueller-Israel-Stewart theory around the transversely homogeneous attractor.
The result is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations which
describes the proper-time evolution of Fourier modes encoding the transverse
structure of the initial energy deposition. The late-time asymptotic behavior
of these solutions is described by transseries which make manifest the
stability of the attractor against transverse perturbations. In this framework,
information about the structure of the plasma in the transverse plane resides
mostly in exponentially suppressed corrections to evolution along the
attractor, which are not yet negligible at freeze-out. These findings also
suggest a simple numerical approach to QGP dynamics using a finite number of
Fourier modes. Physical observables can be expressed in terms of the asymptotic
data evaluated at freeze-out. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by
calculating the final multiplicity distributions and collective flow
coefficients.

**Abstract**: Generative networks are an exciting tool for fast LHC event generation.
Usually, they are used to generate configurations with a fixed number of
particles. Autoregressive transformers allow us to generate events with
variable numbers of particles, very much in line with the physics of QCD jet
radiation. We show how they can learn a factorized likelihood for jet radiation
and extrapolate in terms of the number of generated jets. For this
extrapolation, bootstrapping training data and training with modifications of
the likelihood loss can be used.


### Accurate Surrogate Amplitudes with Calibrated Uncertainties
**Authors**: Henning Bahl, Nina Elmer, Luigi Favaro, Manuel Haußmann, Tilman Plehn, Ramon Winterhalder

**Published Date**: 2024-12-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12069v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12069v1)

**Abstract**: Neural networks for LHC physics have to be accurate, reliable, and
controlled. Using surrogate loop amplitudes as a use case, we first show how
activation functions can be systematically tested with KANs. For reliability
and control, we learn uncertainties together with the target amplitude over
phase space. Systematic uncertainties can be learned by a heteroscedastic loss,
but a comprehensive learned uncertainty requires Bayesian networks or repulsive
ensembles. We compute pull distributions to show to what level learned
uncertainties are calibrated correctly for cutting-edge precision surrogates.


### Quasinormal coupled-mode analysis of dynamic gain in exceptional-point lasers
**Authors**: Hao He, Xingwei Gao, Alexander Cerjan, Chia Wei Hsu

**Published Date**: 2024-12-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12066v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12066v1)

**Abstract**: One of the key features of lasers operating near exceptional points (EPs) is
that the gain medium can support an oscillating population inversion above a
pump threshold, leading to self-modulated laser dynamics. This unusual behavior
opens up new possibilities for frequency comb generation and temporal
modulation. However, the dynamic population inversion couples signals with
different frequencies and thus cannot be captured by conventional temporal
coupled-mode theory (TCMT) based on static saturable gain. In this paper, we
develop a perturbative coupled-mode analysis framework to capture the
spatial-temporal dynamics of near-EP lasers. By decomposing discrete frequency
generation into multiple excitations of resonant modes, our analysis
establishes a minimal physical model that translates the local distribution of
dynamic population-inversion into a resonant modal interpretation of laser
gain. This work enables the exploration of unique properties in this
self-time-modulated systems, such as time-varying scattering and non-reciprocal
transmission.


### Quantum Frequency Mixing using an N-$V$ Diamond Microscope
**Authors**: Samuel J. Karlson, Pauli Kehayias, Jennifer M. Schloss, Andrew C. Maccabe, Adam Libson, David F. Phillips, Guoqing Wang, Paola Cappellaro, Danielle A. Braje

**PDF Url**: [2407.07025v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07025v2)

**Abstract**: Wide-field magnetic microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond
can yield high-quality magnetic images of DC and AC magnetic fields. The unique
combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at
room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique
for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and
electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success
in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited.
In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently
developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we
generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating
currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry
methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in
hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics
diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12044v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12044v1)

**Abstract**: This work deals with two real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime,
with the fields coupled to allow the study of localized configurations. We
consider models constructed to engender geometric constrictions, and use them
to investigate solutions of the lump type, which attain no topological
properties. We show how to modify the internal structure of the field
configurations and the corresponding energy densities in several distinct ways,
making them thinner, thicker and also, in the form of a multi-lump solution
composed of two or more lumps or asymmetrically distributed around their
associated centers. The results appear to be of current interest in high energy
physics and may, in particular, be used to study bright solitons in optical
fibers and in Bose-Einstein condensates.


### Thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks for real-time simulation of digital human twins
**Authors**: Lucas Tesán, David González, Pedro Martins, Elías Cueto

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12034v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12034v1)

**Abstract**: The growing importance of real-time simulation in the medical field has
exposed the limitations and bottlenecks inherent in the digital representation
of complex biological systems. This paper presents a novel methodology aimed at
advancing current lines of research in soft tissue simulation. The proposed
approach introduces a hybrid model that integrates the geometric bias of graph
neural networks with the physical bias derived from the imposition of a
metriplectic structure as soft and hard constrains in the architecture, being
able to simulate hepatic tissue with dissipative properties. This approach
provides an efficient solution capable of generating predictions at high
feedback rate while maintaining a remarkable generalization ability for
previously unseen anatomies. This makes these features particularly relevant in
the context of precision medicine and haptic rendering.
  Based on the adopted methodologies, we propose a model that predicts human
liver responses to traction and compression loads in as little as 7.3
milliseconds for optimized configurations and as fast as 1.65 milliseconds in
the most efficient cases, all in the forward pass. The model achieves relative
position errors below 0.15\%, with stress tensor and velocity estimations
maintaining relative errors under 7\%. This demonstrates the robustness of the
approach developed, which is capable of handling diverse load states and
anatomies effectively. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating
real-time simulation with patient-specific geometries through deep learning,
paving the way for more robust digital human twins in medical applications.


### The causal structure of the quark propagator
**Authors**: Jan M. Pawlowski, Jonas Wessely

**Published Date**: 2024-12-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12033v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12033v1)

**Abstract**: We study the causal structure of the quark propagator with the spectral DSE.
The spectral gap equation is solved with the input of the spectral
representation of the gluon and a causal STI-construction for the quark-gluon
vertex. The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex
strength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical
strength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below
which the quark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of
the first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that
the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex
conjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass
and peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to
violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the
vertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the
critical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the
classical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how
these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral
symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the
quark-gluon vertex.


### Heterogeneous Freeform Metasurfaces: A Platform for Advanced Broadband Dispersion Engineering
**Authors**: Zhaoyi Li, Sawyer D. Campell, Joon-Suh Park, Ronald P. Jenkins, Soon Wei Daniel Lim, Douglas H. Werner, Federico Capasso

**Abstract**: Metasurfaces, with their ability to control electromagnetic waves, hold
immense potential in optical device design, especially for applications
requiring precise control over dispersion. This work introduces an approach to
dispersion engineering using heterogeneous freeform metasurfaces, which
overcomes the limitations of conventional metasurfaces that often suffer from
poor transmission, narrow bandwidth, and restricted polarization responses. By
transitioning from single-layer, canonical meta-atoms to bilayer architectures
with non-intuitive geometries, our design decouples intrinsic material
properties (refractive index and group index), enabling independent engineering
of phase and group delays as well as higher-order dispersion properties, while
achieving high-efficiency under arbitrary polarization states. We implement a
two-stage multi-objective optimization process to generate libraries of
meta-atoms, which are then utilized for the rapid design of
dispersion-engineered metasurfaces. Additionally, we present a bilayer
metasurface stacking technique, paving the way for the realization of
high-performance, dispersion-engineered optical devices. Our approach is
validated through the demonstration of metasurfaces exhibiting superior
chromatic aberration correction and broadband performance, with over 81%
averaged efficiency across the 420-nm visible-to-near-infrared bandwidth. Our
synergistic combination of advanced design physics, powerful freeform
optimization methods, and bi-layer nanofabrication techniques represents a
significant breakthrough compared to the state-of-the-art while opening new
possibilities for broadband metasurface applications.

**Abstract**: Modelling the underlying event in high-energy hadronic collisions is
important for physics at colliders. This includes lepton colliders, where
low-virtuality photons accompanying the lepton beam(s) may develop hadronic
structure. Similarly, photon-induced collisions also occur in proton or
heavy-ion beam experiments. While the underlying event in proton-proton
collisions has been the subject of much study at the LHC, studies of
hadronic-photon-induced underlying event are now of increasing interest in
light of planned future lepton and lepton-hadron colliders, as well as the
photon-induced processes in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC. Here we
present an investigation of the underlying event in photon-initiated processes,
starting from the PYTHIA models used to describe LHC and Tevatron data, and
revisiting HERA and LEP2 data. While no single tune describes all the data with
different beam configurations, we find that a good agreement can still be found
within the same model by adjusting the relevant parameters separately for
$\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma p$ and $pp$. This suggests that the basic model of
multiparton interaction implemented in PYTHIA can be applied for different beam
configurations. Furthermore, we find that a reasonable agreement for
$\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma p$ data, and for $pp$ data at an LHC reference
energy, can be found within a single parametrization, but $pp$ collisions would
prefer a stronger energy dependence, leading to too many multiparton
interactions in lower energy photon-induced collisions. On this basis, we make
some recommendations for simulations of photon-induced processes, such as
$\gamma \gamma$ events at the LHC or FCC and $ep$ or $eA$ collisions at the
EIC, and suggest possibilities for improvements in the modelling.


## Diffusion
### FSFM: A Generalizable Face Security Foundation Model via Self-Supervised Facial Representation Learning
**Authors**: Gaojian Wang, Feng Lin, Tong Wu, Zhenguang Liu, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren

**Published Date**: 2024-12-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12032v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12032v1)

**Abstract**: This work asks: with abundant, unlabeled real faces, how to learn a robust
and transferable facial representation that boosts various face security tasks
with respect to generalization performance? We make the first attempt and
propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental
representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore
various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful
CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful
intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore,
we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish
underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These
three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and
global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a
universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks:
cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen
diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets
demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual
and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized
SOTA methods.


### BrushEdit: All-In-One Image Inpainting and Editing
**Authors**: Yaowei Li, Yuxuan Bian, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Yuexian Zou, Qiang Xu

**Published Date**: 2024-12-13

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.10316v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10316v2)

**Abstract**: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion
models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However,
current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g.,
adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise,
which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often
constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for
specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we
propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing
paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image
inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive
free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling
free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image
inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category
classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area
inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines
MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven
metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.

**Authors**: Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Yueyan Li, Zilu Guo, Jun Du, Shutong Niu, Jiefeng Ma, Shan He, Xiaoyan Wu, Qiming Hu, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Qingfeng Liu

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of talking head generation,
yet still face challenges in expressiveness, controllability, and stability in
long-time generation. In this research, we propose an EmotiveTalk framework to
address these issues. Firstly, to realize better control over the generation of
lip movement and facial expression, a Vision-guided Audio Information
Decoupling (V-AID) approach is designed to generate audio-based decoupled
representations aligned with lip movements and expression. Specifically, to
achieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we
present a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within
V-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion
condition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head
Diffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking
head videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to
automatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while
integrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive
generation performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate
expressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of
emotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art
performance compared to existing methods.


### Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning via Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified
that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of
RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of
unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies, and providing the agent with
enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on the
application of diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into
online RL is less investigated. The training objective of the diffusion model,
known as the variational lower bound, cannot be optimized directly in online RL
due to the unavailability of 'good' actions. This leads to difficulties in
conducting diffusion policy improvement. To overcome this, we propose a novel
model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm, Q-weighted Variational Policy
Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational
loss, which can be proved to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective in
online RL under certain conditions. To fulfill these conditions, the Q-weight
transformation functions are introduced for general scenarios. Additionally, to
further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a
special entropy regularization term. We also develop an efficient behavior
policy to enhance sample efficiency by reducing the variance of the diffusion
policy during online interactions. Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages
the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies,
preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the
effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo
benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.


### No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need
**Authors**: Minghao Xu, Lichuan Xiang, Xu Cai, Hongkai Wen

**Published Date**: 2024-12-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.11768v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11768v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for
training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to
stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning
rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by
their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning
rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent
training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's
memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency,
SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of
Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of
using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K
classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large
language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to
hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further
tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion
models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a
memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for
optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters)
and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training
settings.
