**Abstract**: Spatial perception is a fundamental component of intelligence. While many
studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to
reason about space, they only test for static spatial reasoning, such as
categorizing the relative positions of objects. Meanwhile, real-world
deployment requires dynamic capabilities like perspective-taking and egocentric
action recognition. As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we
introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative
object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K
question-answer pairs for 22K synthetic scenes across a training and testing
set. Generated using a photo-realistic physics engine, our dataset can be
arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets.
We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions
struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that
SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT,
but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks:
$23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When
instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like
GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning. Our data/code is available at

**Abstract**: We identify a mechanism in long-range Heisenberg spin chains at low
temperatures that results in the emergence of effective entanglement light
cones. This mechanism arises from destructive interference among quantum
effects entangling spins outside an identified light cone. As a result,
entanglement is suppressed in this region, enabling the formation of effective
light cones. The analysis shows that truncating the range of interactions
diminishes the destructive interference, leading to an unexpected acceleration
of entanglement transport along the chain and offering new opportunities to
experimentally demonstrate the destructive interference phenomenon. This work
provides a fresh perspective on the physical mechanism underlying the emergence
of light cones in long-range interacting quantum systems

**PDF Url**: [2409.05893v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05893v2)

**Abstract**: In this work, we propose a data-driven method to discover the latent space
and learn the corresponding latent dynamics for a collisional-radiative (CR)
model in radiative plasma simulations. The CR model, consisting of
high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), must be solved
at each grid point in the configuration space, leading to significant
computational costs in plasma simulations. Our method employs a
physics-assisted autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional latent representation
of the original CR system. A flow map neural network is then used to learn the
latent dynamics. Once trained, the reduced surrogate model predicts the entire
latent dynamics given only the initial condition by iteratively applying the
flow map. The radiative power loss is then reconstructed using a decoder.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can accurately
predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the radiative power loss rate.


### Probing nonperturbative transverse momentum dependent PDFs with chiral perturbation theory: the $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry

**PDF Url**: [2412.07717v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07717v1)

**Abstract**: We use chiral perturbation theory to study the long distance regime of
transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs). Chiral
corrections to the TMD PDFs are computed from proton to pion/baryon splittings.
For consistent power counting, we find that the fraction of the proton's
momentum that a pion may carry must be kept small. We make predictions for a
$\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry in the proton's TMD PDFs and find that the
effective theory gives a natural exponential suppression of the TMD PDF at long
distances. We then explore the effects that additional nonperturbative physics
may have on the TMD $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry.

**Abstract**: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental
measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle
physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art
calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta
decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the
latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked
forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta
decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used
estimates from Enomoto~\cite{Enomoto}, reveals notable distinction in the
energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering
the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant
deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4\% for Uranium-238 and 9\% for
Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux
model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the
analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around
10\% to 20\%.

**Abstract**: Various phenomenological consequences of seesaw theories for the generation
of the fermion mass hierarchy of the Standard Model have been analyzed, with an
emphasis on models in which the light-active neutrino masses are derived from
low-scale seesaw mechanisms. In particular, fermion masses and lepton
flavor-violating decay processes, the flavor-changing neutral current, have
been studied, and the implications of these theories for the observed dark
matter relic density in the Universe have been determined. From the analysis of
these phenomenological aspects, it was possible to determine the allowed
parameter spaces of these theories and to obtain a parameter fit consistent
with the currently measured experimental values. In this way, correlations
between the different observables of the fermionic sector could be obtained,
where all values were within the experimental ranges at $3\sigma$. Predictions
for new physics consistent with cosmological limits were also obtained.

**Abstract**: Advances in atomic physics have led to the possibility of a coherent
transformation between ultra-cold atoms and molecules including between
completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the
magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage
through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of
generic interaction between the constituent atoms and molecules can
fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the
reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the
correlations introduced by this interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics
such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective
formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We
provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these effects, along with
scaling laws for the reaction yield in non-adiabatic regimes.

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies are designed to predict actions based on
current observations to maximize cumulative future rewards. In real-world
applications (i.e., non-simulated environments), sensors are essential for
measuring the current state and providing the observations on which RL policies
rely to make decisions. A significant challenge in deploying RL policies in
real-world scenarios is handling sensor dropouts, which can result from
hardware malfunctions, physical damage, or environmental factors like dust on a
camera lens. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is the use of backup
sensors, though this comes with added costs. This paper explores the
optimization of backup sensor configurations to maximize expected returns while
keeping costs below a specified threshold, C. Our approach uses a second-order
approximation of expected returns and includes penalties for exceeding cost
constraints. We then optimize this quadratic program using Tabu Search, a
meta-heuristic algorithm. The approach is evaluated across eight OpenAI Gym
environments and a custom Unity-based robotic environment (RobotArmGrasping).
Empirical results demonstrate that our quadratic program effectively
approximates real expected returns, facilitating the identification of optimal
sensor configurations.

**Abstract**: Hamiltonian exceptional points (HEPs) are spectral degeneracies of
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing classical and semiclassical open systems
with losses and/or gain. However, this definition overlooks the occurrence of
quantum jumps in the evolution of open quantum systems. These quantum effects
are properly accounted for by considering quantum Liouvillians and their
exceptional points (LEPs). Specifically, an LEP corresponds to the coalescence
of two or more eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenmatrices of a given
Liouvillian at critical values of external parameters [Minganti \emph{et al.},
Phys. Rev. A {\bf 100}, 062131 (2019)]. Here, we explicitly describe how
standard quantum process tomography, which reveals the dynamics of a quantum
system, can be readily applied to detect and characterize quantum LEPs of
quantum non-Hermitian systems. We conducted experiments on an IBM quantum
processor to implement a prototype model with one-, two-, and three qubits
simulating the decay of a single qubit through competing channels, resulting in
LEPs but not HEPs. Subsequently, we performed tomographic reconstruction of the
corresponding experimental Liouvillian and its LEPs using both single- and
two-qubit operations. This example underscores the efficacy of process
tomography in tuning and observing LEPs even in the absence of HEPs.


### BPS Dendroscopy on Local $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$

**Abstract**: BPS states in type II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold can
typically be decomposed as moduli-dependent bound states of absolutely stable
constituents, with a hierarchical structure labelled by attractor flow trees.
This decomposition is best understood from the scattering diagram, an
arrangement of real codimension-one loci (or rays) in the space of stability
conditions where BPS states of given electromagnetic charge and fixed phase of
the central charge exist. The consistency of the diagram when rays intersect
determines all BPS indices in terms of the `attractor indices' carried by the
initial rays. In this work we study the scattering diagram for a non-compact
toric CY threefold known as local $\mathbb{F}_0$, namely the total space of the
canonical bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. We first construct the
scattering diagram for the quiver, valid near the orbifold point, and for the
large volume slice, valid when both $\mathbb{P}^1$'s have large (and nearly
equal) area. We then combine the insights gained from these simple limits to
construct the scattering diagram along the physical slice of $\Pi$-stability
conditions, which carries an action of a $\mathbb{Z}^4$ extension of the
modular group $\Gamma_0(4)$. We sketch a proof of the Split Attractor Flow Tree
Conjecture in this example, albeit for a restricted range of the central charge
phase. Most arguments are similar to our early study of local $\mathbb{P}^2$
[arXiv:2210.10712], but complicated by the occurence of an extra mass parameter
and ramification points on the $\Pi$-stability slice.


## Diffusion
### Video Motion Transfer with Diffusion Transformers

**PDF Url**: [2412.07776v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07776v1)

**Abstract**: We propose DiTFlow, a method for transferring the motion of a reference video
to a newly synthesized one, designed specifically for Diffusion Transformers
(DiT). We first process the reference video with a pre-trained DiT to analyze
cross-frame attention maps and extract a patch-wise motion signal called the
Attention Motion Flow (AMF). We guide the latent denoising process in an
optimization-based, training-free, manner by optimizing latents with our AMF
loss to generate videos reproducing the motion of the reference one. We also
apply our optimization strategy to transformer positional embeddings, granting
us a boost in zero-shot motion transfer capabilities. We evaluate DiTFlow
against recently published methods, outperforming all across multiple metrics
and human evaluation.

**Abstract**: While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on
target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained
diffusion models on some reward functions that are either designed by experts
or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing methods for finetuning diffusion
models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of
prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. Inspired by recent
successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets), a class of probabilistic
models that sample with the unnormalized density of a reward function, we
propose a novel GFlowNet method dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as
$\nabla$-GFlowNet), the first GFlowNet method that leverages the rich signal in
reward gradients, together with an objective called $\nabla$-DB plus its
variant residual $\nabla$-DB designed for prior-preserving diffusion alignment.
We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and
prior-preserving alignment of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned
image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.

**Abstract**: Three-dimensional (3D) understanding of objects and scenes play a key role in
humans' ability to interact with the world and has been an active area of
research in computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Large scale synthetic and
object-centric 3D datasets have shown to be effective in training models that
have 3D understanding of objects. However, applying a similar approach to
real-world objects and scenes is difficult due to a lack of large-scale data.
Videos are a potential source for real-world 3D data, but finding diverse yet
corresponding views of the same content has shown to be difficult at scale.
Furthermore, standard videos come with fixed viewpoints, determined at the time
of capture. This restricts the ability to access scenes from a variety of more
diverse and potentially useful perspectives. We argue that large scale 360
videos can address these limitations to provide: scalable corresponding frames
from diverse views. In this paper, we introduce 360-1M, a 360 video dataset,
and a process for efficiently finding corresponding frames from diverse
viewpoints at scale. We train our diffusion-based model, Odin, on 360-1M.
Empowered by the largest real-world, multi-view dataset to date, Odin is able
to freely generate novel views of real-world scenes. Unlike previous methods,
Odin can move the camera through the environment, enabling the model to infer
the geometry and layout of the scene. Additionally, we show improved
performance on standard novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction benchmarks.

**Abstract**: Audio-driven talking face generation is a challenging task in digital
communication. Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods
concentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as
visual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing
realistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel,
customizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named
PortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework
consisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is
designed to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video
frames, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion
consistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference
images, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in
existing approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of
text prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly
expands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive
experiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model
demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a
new standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces
suitable for real-world applications.

**Abstract**: The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there
remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the
development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model
architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a
simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV.
Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint
image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to
perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks
simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various
applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view
generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies
on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple
design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V,
surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika,
Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result
of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and
extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to
empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and
reliable video generation solutions.
