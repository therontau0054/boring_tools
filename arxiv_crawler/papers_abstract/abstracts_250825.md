**Abstract**: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.

**Abstract**: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is
unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is
described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the
planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad
master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence,
uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad
dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium
phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first
class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study
nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the
existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the
second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of
nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the
quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary
results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement
bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the
nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.

**Abstract**: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to
investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such
as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate
electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive
neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging
physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training
data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to
traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on
a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of
laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly
modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental
parameters.

**PDF Url**: [2508.16551v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16551v1)

**Abstract**: This study presents a detailed investigation of the modulational stability of
interfacial wave packets in a two-layer inviscid incompressible fluid with
finite layer thicknesses and interfacial surface tension. The stability
analysis is carried out for a broad range of density ratios and geometric
configurations, enabling the construction of stability diagrams in the (\rho,k)
-plane, where \rho is the density ratio and k is the carrier wavenumber. The
Benjamin-Feir index is used as the stability criterion, and its interplay with
the curvature of the dispersion relation is examined to determine the onset of
modulational instability. The topology of the stability diagrams reveals
several characteristic structures: a localized loop of stability within an
instability zone, a global upper stability domain, an elongated corridor
bounded by resonance and dispersion curves, and a degenerate cut structure
arising in strongly asymmetric configurations. Each of these structures is
associated with a distinct physical mechanism involving the balance between
focusing/defocusing nonlinearity and anomalous/normal dispersion. Systematic
variation of layer thicknesses allows us to track the formation, deformation,
and disappearance of these regions, as well as their merging or segmentation
due to resonance effects. Limiting cases of semi-infinite layers are analyzed
to connect the results with known configurations, including the
`half-space--layer', `layer--half-space', and `half-space--half-space' systems.
The influence of symmetry and asymmetry in layer geometry is examined in
detail, showing how it governs the arrangement and connectivity of stable and
unstable regions in parameter space.

**Abstract**: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($\,a_{\mu}\,$) provides a
stringent test of the quantum nature of the Standard Model (SM) and its
extensions. To probe beyond the SM physics, one needs to be able to subtract
the SM contributions, which consists of a non-perturbative part, namely, the
hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the photon. The state of the art is to
predominantly use two different methods to extract this HVP: lattice
computation, and dispersion relation-based, data-driven method. Thus one can
construct different forms of the ``$a_{\mu}$ test" which compares the precise
measurement of $a_{\mu}$ to its theory prediction. Additionally, this opens the
possibility for another subtle test, where these two ``theory" predictions
themselves are compared against each other, which is denoted as the
``HVP-test". This test is particularly sensitive to hadronic scale new physics.
Therefore, in this work, we consider a SM extension consisting of a generic,
light $\sim(100~{\rm MeV}-1~{\rm GeV})$ vector boson and study its impact on
both tests. We develop a comprehensive formalism for this purpose. We find that
in the case of data-driven HVP being used in the $a_{\mu}$ test, the new
physics contributions effectively cancels for a flavor-universal vector boson.
As an illustration of these general results, we consider two benchmark models:
i)~the dark photon ($\,A'\,$) and ii)~a gauge boson coupled to baryon-number
($\,B\,$). Using a combination of these tests, we are able to constrain the
parameter space of $B$ and $A'$, complementarily to the existing limits. As a
spin-off, our preliminary analysis of the spectrum of invariant mass of $3\pi$
in events with ISR at the $B-$ factories (BaBar, Belle) manifests the value of
such a study in searching for $B\to 3\pi$ decay, thus motivating a dedicated
search by experimental collaborations.

**Abstract**: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The
code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.

**PDF Url**: [2508.16518v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16518v1)

**Abstract**: We have developed an Uncertainty Quantification process for multistep
pipelines and applied it to the ACORN particle tracking pipeline. All our
experiments are made using the TrackML open dataset. Using the Monte Carlo
Dropout method, we measure the data and model uncertainties of the pipeline
steps, study how they propagate down the pipeline, and how they are impacted by
the training dataset's size, the input data's geometry and physical properties.
We will show that for our case study, as the training dataset grows, the
overall uncertainty becomes dominated by aleatoric uncertainty, indicating that
we had sufficient data to train the ACORN model we chose to its full potential.
We show that the ACORN pipeline yields high confidence in the track
reconstruction and does not suffer from the miscalibration of the GNN model.


### The twisted geometry of 6d F-theory vacua with discrete gauge symmetries

**Abstract**: We study the fate of discrete gauge groups and discrete charges of
gravitational theories under twisted circle compactification. We then apply our
results to six-dimensional F-theory vacua with discrete gauge symmetries and
relate them to the geometry of the genus one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds that
underlie the dual M-theory compactifications. This leads us to introduce a
class of geometries, which we call almost generic elliptic/genus one fibered
Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to make detailed conjectures about their properties.
A second twisted circle compactification relates these M-theory vacua to Type
IIA compactifications with flat but topologically non-trivial B-fields along
the internal geometry. The A-model topological string partition function on
such configurations is intimately tied to the twisted-twined elliptic genera of
the six-dimensional non-critical strings of the associated F-theory vacuum. The
modular properties of the twisted-twined elliptic genera imply new twisted
derived equivalences. We thus recover and significantly extend earlier results
from both the physical and the mathematical literature. An important outcome of
our study is that if the discrete gauge symmetry is not cyclic, then no smooth
genus one fibration exists that represents the associated axio-dilaton profile.

**PDF Url**: [2508.16483v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16483v1)

**Abstract**: The observation of skyrmions across diverse physical domains suggests that
they are universal features of S$^{2}$-valued fields, reflecting the ubiquity
of topology in the study of the natural world. In this paper, we develop an
abstract technique of parameter space dimensionality reduction that extends the
skyrmion framework to fields taking values in manifolds of dimension greater
than 2, thereby broadening the range of systems that can support skyrmions. To
prove that this is more than just a mathematical abstraction, we apply our
technique to light-matter interactions, directly encoding skyrmionic structures
into the optical anisotropy of spatially varying structured matter by selecting
a distinguished axis, which is fundamentally different from the more commonly
known skyrmions formed by director fields in liquid crystals. We experimentally
realize such skyrmions using a liquid-crystal-based tunable elliptical retarder
array as a proof-of-concept platform and demonstrate complex, reconfigurable
skyrmionic states exhibiting topological robustness under artificially
introduced stochastic perturbations. Exploiting this robustness, we demonstrate
a promising application of skyrmions in topologically protected information
storage and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the physically
realized S$^{2}$-valued field can differ from the designed field everywhere by
a large margin of error (up to 60{\deg}) without affecting the underlying
topological charge.


## Diffusion
### MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview Diffusion
**Authors**: Yosef Dayani, Omer Benishu, Sagie Benaim

**Published Date**: 2025-08-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-22

**PDF Url**: [2508.16577v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16577v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.


### Time-Aware One Step Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.


### Constraints-Guided Diffusion Reasoner for Neuro-Symbolic Learning

**Abstract**: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin
diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in
the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution
$p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of
smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of
$f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our
algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms
under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third
derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a
2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order
convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression
across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive
performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the
popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).


### Generative diffusion posterior sampling for informative likelihoods

**PDF Url**: [2506.01083v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01083v2)

**Abstract**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results
for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we
propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical
efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative
likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates
with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation
for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.
