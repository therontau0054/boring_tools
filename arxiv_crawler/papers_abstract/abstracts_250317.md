**Abstract**: Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its
statistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a
rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when
it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and
an efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant
estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The
reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank
dimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the
lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make
progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal
is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte
Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a \emph{denoising-factorisation
transition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant
estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same
nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and
better denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is
only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself,
becomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine
mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access
the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our
alternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of
[3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we
conjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality
when it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole
phase diagram when considering finite size effects.

**Abstract**: We extend the re-simulation-based self-supervised learning approach to
learning representations of hadronic jets in colliders by exploiting the Markov
property of the standard simulation chain. Instead of masking, cropping, or
other forms of data augmentation, this approach simulates pairs of events where
the initial portion of the simulation is shared, but the subsequent stages of
the simulation evolve independently. When paired with a contrastive loss
function, this naturally leads to representations that capture the physics in
the initial stages of the simulation. In particular, we force the hard
scattering and parton shower to be shared and let the hadronization and
interaction with the detector evolve independently. We then evaluate the
utility of these representations on downstream tasks.

**Abstract**: The discrete rotational symmetry of crystals leads to the conservation of
quantized angular momentum in solids. While the exchange of energy and linear
momentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a
cornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular
momentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular
momentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant
magnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity,
ultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process
of phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach
any magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena
in solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of
angular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical
nonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp
scattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold
rotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify
nonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel,
confirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications
for angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses
the natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular
momentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics,
representing a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and
chiral quasi-particles.


### Noise immunity in quantum optical systems through non-Hermitian topology

**Abstract**: Multimode nonlinear optical systems are highly valued for their ability to
withstand large amounts of optical power, transmit data with high bandwidth,
perform physical computations, generate quantum correlations, and much more.
For many of these applications, both classical and quantum noise place
limitations on important performance metrics. Moreover, it is well known that
nonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial
conditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be
used to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that
non-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the
non-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We
demonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin
effect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for
isolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise.
Our findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or
oscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of
noise. Moreover, our approach provides a new means to connect non-Hermitian
topology with nonlinear many-body systems, which is expected to lead to
topological descriptions of interacting states of light.

**Abstract**: "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction
distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem
upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the
effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on
deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$
symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and
analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge
fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not
it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing
universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the
limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy
principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This
limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and
measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona
fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary
approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations
in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical
calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge
fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but
not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the
most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries
and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization
to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.

**Abstract**: Non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems exhibit many fascinating phenomena
absent in equilibrium systems, but simulating them on classical computers is
challenging. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm,
Floquet-ADAPT-VQE, to simulate the non-equilibrium physics of periodically
driven quantum systems. We utilize the Floquet-Hilbert space, a composition of
auxiliary and physical spaces, to transform the Hamiltonian into a
time-independent form. We define a cost function based on the square of the
shifted extended Floquet Hamiltonian and show how to prepare Floquet
eigenstates using Floquet-ADAPT-VQE. We also obtain a suitable auxiliary
initial state whose squared Floquet energy is independent of the number of
auxiliary qubits as well as the driving frequency, which leads to better
convergence with fewer ADAPT iterations. Additionally, we provide a framework
to calculate the time-dependent expectation value of observables in the Floquet
state with fixed-depth quantum circuit. We demonstrate our algorithm by
performing numerical simulations on a periodically driven XYZ model with a
magnetic field. We also explore potential applications of our algorithm for
studying various non-equilibrium phenomena in periodically driven systems.


### Model-Agnostic Knowledge Guided Correction for Improved Neural Surrogate Rollout

**Abstract**: Modeling the evolution of physical systems is critical to many applications
in science and engineering. As the evolution of these systems is governed by
partial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational
simulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these
simulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed
for large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural
network surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more
computationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high
rollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with
training data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout
error by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of
the model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers'
in the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with
physical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and
simulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially
in legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement
Learning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which
combines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with
or without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly. In
addition to reducing in-distribution rollout error by 47%-78%, HyPER learns an
intelligent policy that is adaptable to changing physical conditions and
resistant to noise corruption. Code available at

### Penguin decays of B mesons
**Authors**: Aritra Biswas

**Published Date**: 2025-03-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-14

**PDF Url**: [2503.11587v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11587v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a set of optimized observables using penguin mediated $\bar{B}_d$
and $\bar{B}_s$ decays to $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $K^*\phi$ final states
that exhibhit a reduced sensitivity to power corrections than the corresponding
branching ratios. Using these observables, branching ratios for the related
vector-vector and pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar modes and branching ratios for
modes involving other relevant pseudoscalar-vector final states ($K\phi$,
$K^*\bar{K})$, we attempt to resolve the emergent combined pattern by assuming
new physics contributions to the weak effective operators at the scale of the
mass of the $b$ quark that are already present in the Standard Model. We find
that the simplest scenario that can offer a simultaneous explanation is the
two-operator scenario $Q_{4s,d}-Q_{6s,d}$. We briefly discuss how future
experimental measurements may alter this picture and try to motivate such
measurements for specific modes from our analysis.

**PDF Url**: [2412.14949v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14949v2)

**Abstract**: We investigate the global structure of the Gauged Two-Higgs-Doublet Model
(G2HDM), a framework that extends the Standard Model by introducing a dark
sector governed by the gauge symmetry $U(1)_X \times SU(2)_H$. The full gauge
symmetry of the theory, including the visible sector, is given by the universal
covering group $\tilde{G} = U(1)_Y \times SU(2)_L \times SU(3)_C \times U(1)_X
\times SU(2)_H$. However, the true gauge group may instead be a quotient $G =
\tilde{G} / \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the center of $\tilde{G}$ or a subgroup
thereof, leading to different global structures that cannot be distinguished by
local experiments.We explore the physical implications of these global
structures, analyzing their effects on Wilson, 't Hooft, and dyonic line
operators, as well as the periodicity of the CP-violating $\theta$-angles
associated with each group factor. Furthermore, we determine the minimal
electric and magnetic charges that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking,
highlighting their dependence on the choice of $\Gamma$. These findings provide
a systematic characterization of the G2HDM's global properties and their
potential phenomenological consequences.

**PDF Url**: [2503.11581v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11581v1)

**Abstract**: Optical bound-states in the continuum (BICs) have greatly enriched the field
of nonlinear optics with novel ways to control and manipulate light-matter
interaction at the nanoscale. This has been made possible by their unique
physical properties, including effective confinement of light, non-trivial
topological features, and robustness upon the propagation of the optical field
both in the real and momentum space. Regarding the exploration of nonlinear
optical response in various photonic nanostructures supporting BICs, particular
attention has been paid to optical metasurfaces, chiefly due to their ability
to control the light flow at subwavelength scale, design and fabrication
flexibility, and convenient phase-matching conditions. In this review, we
outline and discuss recent advances in metasurface-based frequency conversion
processes utilizing the versatile physics of BICs, with a particular emphasis
on the main physics background pertaining to nonlinear optical phenomena and
optics of BICs, as well as state-of-the-art functionalities enabled by
BIC-driven nonlinear metasurfaces. These applications include harmonic
generation, harmonic chiroptical effects, generation of complex quantum states,
and broadband terahertz generation. In addition, several emerging research
fields and the existing challenges of photonic nanodevices relying on BICs are
discussed.

### From Denoising Score Matching to Langevin Sampling: A Fine-Grained Error Analysis in the Gaussian Setting
**Authors**: Samuel Hurault, Matthieu Terris, Thomas Moreau, Gabriel Peyré

**PDF Url**: [2503.11615v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11615v1)

**Abstract**: Sampling from an unknown distribution, accessible only through discrete
samples, is a fundamental problem at the core of generative AI. The current
state-of-the-art methods follow a two-step process: first estimating the score
function (the gradient of a smoothed log-distribution) and then applying a
gradient-based sampling algorithm. The resulting distribution's correctness can
be impacted by several factors: the generalization error due to a finite number
of initial samples, the error in score matching, and the diffusion error
introduced by the sampling algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the sampling
process in a simple yet representative setting-sampling from Gaussian
distributions using a Langevin diffusion sampler. We provide a sharp analysis
of the Wasserstein sampling error that arises from the multiple sources of
error throughout the pipeline. This allows us to rigorously track how the
anisotropy of the data distribution (encoded by its power spectrum) interacts
with key parameters of the end-to-end sampling method, including the noise
amplitude, the step sizes in both score matching and diffusion, and the number
of initial samples. Notably, we show that the Wasserstein sampling error can be
expressed as a kernel-type norm of the data power spectrum, where the specific
kernel depends on the method parameters. This result provides a foundation for
further analysis of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing sampling accuracy,
such as adapting the noise amplitude to the choice of step sizes.

**Abstract**: Synchronization is an emergent and fundamental phenomenon in nature and
engineered systems. Understanding the stability of a synchronized phenomenon is
crucial for ensuring functionality in various complex systems. The stability of
the synchronization phenomenon is extensively studied using the Master
Stability Function (MSF). This powerful and elegant tool plays a pivotal role
in determining the stability of synchronization states, providing deep insights
into synchronization in coupled systems. Although MSF analysis has been used
for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic
investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the
literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis
for diverse undirected and directed networked systems. We begin with the
analytical MSF framework for pairwise-coupled identical systems with diffusive
and natural coupling schemes and extend our analysis to directed networks and
multilayer networks, considering both intra-layer and inter-layer interactions.
Furthermore, we revisit the MSF framework to incorporate higher-order
interactions alongside pairwise interactions. To enhance understanding, we also
provide a numerical analysis of synchronization in coupled R\"ossler systems
under pairwise diffusive coupling and propose algorithms for determining the
MSF, identifying stability regimes, and classifying MSF functions. Overall, the
primary goal of this review is to present a systematic study of MSF in coupled
dynamical networks in a clear and structured manner, making this powerful tool
more accessible. Furthermore, we highlight cases where the study of
synchronization states using MSF remains underexplored. Additionally, we
discuss recent research focusing on MSF analysis using time series data and
machine learning approaches.


### Towards Few-Call Model Stealing via Active Self-Paced Knowledge Distillation and Diffusion-Based Image Generation

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-14

**PDF Url**: [2310.00096v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00096v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models showcase strong capabilities in image synthesis, being used
in many computer vision tasks with great success. To this end, we propose to
explore a new use case, namely to copy black-box classification models without
having access to the original training data, the architecture, and the weights
of the model, i.e. the model is only exposed through an inference API. More
specifically, we can only observe the (soft or hard) labels for some image
samples passed as input to the model. Furthermore, we consider an additional
constraint limiting the number of model calls, mostly focusing our research on
few-call model stealing. In order to solve the model extraction task given the
applied restrictions, we propose the following framework. As training data, we
create a synthetic data set (called proxy data set) by leveraging the ability
of diffusion models to generate realistic and diverse images. Given a maximum
number of allowed API calls, we pass the respective number of samples through
the black-box model to collect labels. Finally, we distill the knowledge of the
black-box teacher (attacked model) into a student model (copy of the attacked
model), harnessing both labeled and unlabeled data generated by the diffusion
model. We employ a novel active self-paced learning framework to make the most
of the proxy data during distillation. Our empirical results on three data sets
confirm the superiority of our framework over four state-of-the-art methods in
the few-call model extraction scenario. We release our code for free
non-commercial use at https://github.com/vladhondru25/model-stealing.

**Abstract**: In recent years, the segmentation of short molecular trajectories with
varying diffusive properties has drawn particular attention of researchers,
since it allows studying the dynamics of a particle. In the past decade,
machine learning methods have shown highly promising results, also in
changepoint detection and segmentation tasks. Here, we introduce a novel
iterative method to identify the changepoints in a molecular trajectory, i.e.,
frames, where the diffusive behavior of a particle changes. A trajectory in our
case follows a fractional Brownian motion and we estimate the diffusive
properties of the trajectories. The proposed BI-ADD combines unsupervised and
supervised learning methods to detect the changepoints. Our approach can be
used for the analysis of molecular trajectories at the individual level and
also be extended to multiple particle tracking, which is an important challenge
in fundamental biology. We validated BI-ADD in various scenarios within the
framework of the AnDi2 Challenge 2024 dedicated to single particle tracking.
Our method is implemented in Python and is publicly available for research
purposes.


### Towards A Correct Usage of Cryptography in Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models

**PDF Url**: [2503.11404v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11404v1)

**Abstract**: Semantic watermarking methods enable the direct integration of watermarks
into the generation process of latent diffusion models by only modifying the
initial latent noise. One line of approaches building on Gaussian Shading
relies on cryptographic primitives to steer the sampling process of the latent
noise. However, we identify several issues in the usage of cryptographic
techniques in Gaussian Shading, particularly in its proof of lossless
performance and key management, causing ambiguity in follow-up works, too. In
this work, we therefore revisit the cryptographic primitives for semantic
watermarking. We introduce a novel, general proof of lossless performance based
on IND\$-CPA security for semantic watermarks. We then discuss the
configuration of the cryptographic primitives in semantic watermarks with
respect to security, efficiency, and generation quality.


## Quantitative Finance
### Chat-TS: Enhancing Multi-Modal Reasoning Over Time-Series and Natural Language Data
**Authors**: Paul Quinlan, Qingguo Li, Xiaodan Zhu

**Abstract**: Time-series analysis is critical for a wide range of fields such as
healthcare, finance, transportation, and energy, among many others. The
practical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside
contextual information in the form of natural language to support informed
decisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to
perform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In
this work, we address this gap by introducing \textit{Chat-TS}, a large
language model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time
series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates
time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over
both modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities,
enabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support
learning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the
\textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with
relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \textit{TS
Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice
questions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \textit{TS Instruct
Quantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA
tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation. We
designed a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of
LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that
Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks by
maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series
reasoning. ~\footnote{To ensure replicability and facilitate future research,
all models, datasets, and code will be available at [\texttt{Github-URL}].}
