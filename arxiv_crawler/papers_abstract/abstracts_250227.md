**Abstract**: We reveal a novel aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to
couple with a dilaton field: $\,$The dynamics of the dilaton can induce
variations in the Planck constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. $\,$Our
mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$
spacetimes via the dilaton offers a viable alternative account for late-time
cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.

**Abstract**: Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world
settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish
their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback
during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a
vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability
to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex
commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system
that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning
over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step
to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In
contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple
commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and
incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We
evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm,
dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks
such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.

**Abstract**: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of
discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural
sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural
phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new
area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging
research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly
interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field
is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough
account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and
continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the
subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,
materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales
and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on
these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby
allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to
capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by
deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of
techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss
other common technical challenges, including explainability,
out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and
large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning
and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be
useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may
trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.

**Authors**: F. Hautmann, L. Keersmaekers, A. Lelek, S. Sadeghi Barzani, S. Taheri Monfared

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19380v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19380v1)

**Abstract**: Soft-gluon resolution scales characterize parton branching Monte Carlo
implementations of the evolution equations for parton distribution functions in
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We examine scenarios with dynamical, i.e.,
branching-scale dependent, resolution scale, and discuss physical implications
for both collinear and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) distributions. We
perform the first determination of parton distributions with dynamical
resolution scale, at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory, from
fits to precision deep-inelastic scattering measurements from HERA. We present
an application of TMD distributions with dynamical resolution scale to
Drell-Yan lepton-pair transverse momentum spectra at the LHC, and comment on
the extraction of non-perturbative intrinsic-kT parameters from Drell-Yan data
at small transverse momenta.


### Extracting scattering amplitudes for arbitrary two-particle systems with one-particle left-hand cuts via lattice QCD
**Authors**: André Baião Raposo, Raúl A Briceño, Maxwell T Hansen, Andrew W Jackura

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19375v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19375v1)

**Abstract**: We derive a general formalism that relates the spectrum of two-particle
systems in a finite volume to physical scattering amplitudes, taking into
account the presence of any left-hand branch cuts due to single-particle
exchanges. The method first relates the finite-volume spectrum to an
infinite-volume short-range quantity, denoted \mathcal{M}_0, and then relates
the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes via known integral equations.
The derivation of both relations is performed using all-orders perturbation
theory and is exact up to neglected exponentially suppressed volume dependence.
The relations hold for arbitrary two-particle systems with any number of
coupled channels, non-identical and non-degenerate particles, and any intrinsic
spin.


### The chiral SYK model in three-dimensional holography
**Authors**: Alexander Altland, Dmitry Bagrets, Nele Callebaut, Konstantin Weisenberger

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19370v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19370v1)

**Abstract**: A celebrated realization of the holographic principle posits an approximate
duality between the $(0+1)$-dimensional quantum mechanical SYK model and
two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, mediated by the Schwarzian action as
an effective low energy theory common to both systems. We here propose a
generalization of this correspondence to one dimension higher. Starting from
different microscopic realizations of effectively chiral $(1+1)$-dimensional
generalizations of the SYK model, we derive a reduction to the
Alekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action
which has been proposed as the effective boundary action of three-dimensional
gravity. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around
the Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of
three-dimensional gravity. These two constructions allow us to match bulk and
boundary coupling constants, and to compute observables. Specifically, we apply
semiclassical techniques inspired by condensed matter physics to the
computation of out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), demonstrating
maximal chaos in the chiral SYK chain and its gravity dual.


### Quantum geometric moment encodes stacking order of moiré matter

**Abstract**: Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in
condensed matter physics. Moir\'e materials featuring flat bands provide a
versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In
moir\'e materials that break either time-reversal symmetry or inversion
symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different
stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature
distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains
similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on
the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\circ$ twisted double
bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA)
and forms an inversion broken \moire superlattice with electrically tunable
flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking
order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in
Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD
exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the
perpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric
behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity
in AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum
geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and
detection.


### Deep Learning For Time Series Analysis With Application On Human Motion
**Authors**: Ali Ismail-Fawaz

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19364v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19364v1)

**Abstract**: Time series data, defined by equally spaced points over time, is essential in
fields like medicine, telecommunications, and energy. Analyzing it involves
tasks such as classification, clustering, prototyping, and regression.
Classification identifies normal vs. abnormal movements in skeleton-based
motion sequences, clustering detects stock market behavior patterns,
prototyping expands physical therapy datasets, and regression predicts patient
recovery. Deep learning has recently gained traction in time series analysis
due to its success in other domains. This thesis leverages deep learning to
enhance classification with feature engineering, introduce foundation models,
and develop a compact yet state-of-the-art architecture. We also address
limited labeled data with self-supervised learning. Our contributions apply to
real-world tasks, including human motion analysis for action recognition and
rehabilitation. We introduce a generative model for human motion data, valuable
for cinematic production and gaming. For prototyping, we propose a shape-based
synthetic sample generation method to support regression models when data is
scarce. Lastly, we critically evaluate discriminative and generative models,
identifying limitations in current methodologies and advocating for a robust,
standardized evaluation framework. Our experiments on public datasets provide
novel insights and methodologies, advancing time series analysis with practical
applications.

**Authors**: Aidan Furlong, Xingang Zhao, Robert Salko, Xu Wu

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19357v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19357v1)

**Abstract**: Critical heat flux is a key quantity in boiling system modeling due to its
impact on heat transfer and component temperature and performance. This study
investigates the development and validation of an uncertainty-aware hybrid
modeling approach that combines machine learning with physics-based models in
the prediction of critical heat flux in nuclear reactors for cases of dryout.
Two empirical correlations, Biasi and Bowring, were employed with three machine
learning uncertainty quantification techniques: deep neural network ensembles,
Bayesian neural networks, and deep Gaussian processes. A pure machine learning
model without a base model served as a baseline for comparison. This study
examines the performance and uncertainty of the models under both plentiful and
limited training data scenarios using parity plots, uncertainty distributions,
and calibration curves. The results indicate that the Biasi hybrid deep neural
network ensemble achieved the most favorable performance (with a mean absolute
relative error of 1.846% and stable uncertainty estimates), particularly in the
plentiful data scenario. The Bayesian neural network models showed slightly
higher error and uncertainty but superior calibration. By contrast, deep
Gaussian process models underperformed by most metrics. All hybrid models
outperformed pure machine learning configurations, demonstrating resistance
against data scarcity.

**Authors**: Robyn Larracy, Angkoon Phinyomark, Ala Salehi, Eve MacDonald, Saeed Kazemi, Shikder Shafiul Bashar, Aaron Tabor, Erik Scheme

**Published Date**: 2025-02-24

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.17244v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17244v2)

**Abstract**: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which
are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioural traits.
Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports,
and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture,
advances in underfoot pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights
into gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due
to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, the UNB
StepUP database was created, featuring gait pressure data collected with
high-resolution pressure sensing tiles (4 sensors/cm$^2$, 1.2m by 3.6m). Its
first release, UNB StepUP-P150, includes over 200,000 footsteps from 150
individuals across various walking speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and
slow) and footwear types (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes). As
the largest and most comprehensive dataset of its kind, it supports biometric
gait recognition while presenting new research opportunities in biomechanics
and deep learning. The UNB StepUP-P150 dataset sets a new benchmark for
pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.

### RetinaRegen: A Hybrid Model for Readability and Detail Restoration in Fundus Images
**Authors**: Yuhan Tang, Yudian Wang, Weizhen Li, Ye Yue, Chengchang Pan, Honggang Qi

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19153v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19153v1)

**Abstract**: Fundus image quality is crucial for diagnosing eye diseases, but real-world
conditions often result in blurred or unreadable images, increasing diagnostic
uncertainty. To address these challenges, this study proposes RetinaRegen, a
hybrid model for retinal image restoration that integrates a readability
classifi-cation model, a Diffusion Model, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
Ex-periments on the SynFundus-1M dataset show that the proposed method achieves
a PSNR of 27.4521, an SSIM of 0.9556, and an LPIPS of 0.1911 for the
readability labels of the optic disc (RO) region. These results demonstrate
superior performance in restoring key regions, offering an effective solution
to enhance fundus image quality and support clinical diagnosis.


### CCDM: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Generation
**Authors**: Xin Ding, Yongwei Wang, Kao Zhang, Z. Jane Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-05-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2405.03546v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03546v2)

**Abstract**: Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional
data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables
(aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial
Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during
adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion
Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images,
but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures
are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to
integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce
Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically
tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed
conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a
customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling
procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions
ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform
state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies
further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some
widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.


### Efficient and Accurate Spatial Mixing of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Materials Science
**Authors**: Fraser Birks, Thomas D Swinburne, James R Kermode

**Published Date**: 2025-02-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.19081v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19081v1)

**Abstract**: Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy
but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular
mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package
for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of
different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is
possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an
'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We
demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He
systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without
sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of
minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger
domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is
limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive
potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the
practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling
parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.


### Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning
**Authors**: Philipp Hess, Michael Aich, Baoxiang Pan, Niklas Boers

**Published Date**: 2024-03-05

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-26

**PDF Url**: [2403.02774v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02774v4)

**Abstract**: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are
essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic
climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently
high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown
promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming
state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require
computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to
climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a
consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM
simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields
probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the
observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high
controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to
climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical
constraints.
