**Abstract**: The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a
critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial
reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables
geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core
capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video
prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved
feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across
reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video
generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real
generalization despite never observing real-world data during training.
Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action
following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling.
Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance far
exceeds that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether leverages a
geometry-informed action space to seamlessly translate predictions into
actions, enabling effective autonomous trajectory planning. We hope our work
inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world
modeling and its applications.


### Multimodality in the search for new physics in pulsar timing data and the case of kination-amplified gravitational-wave background from inflation

**Abstract**: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave
background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various
pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in
the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field,
characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB
model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and
EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the
ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the
likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the
free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher
signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock
spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr
(NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first
time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current
NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal
posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is
$B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable
statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical
model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor
spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial
spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic
microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer
measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by
the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.

**Abstract**: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar
effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of
field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as
coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance
to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing
on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how
loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature
of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured
through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes
the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space
backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the
contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the
field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a
universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple
models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This
geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight
into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.

**Abstract**: A Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) valid for compact quasisymmetric stellarators
is derived by an asymptotic expansion around a vacuum field carried to first
order. We obtain an equation for the existence of flux surfaces leading up to
the GSE. The flux surface label must simultaneously satisfy the existence
equation and the GSE, which generally leads to an overdetermined problem. We
show how the overdetermined problem can be resolved within our model for a
class of hybrid devices similar to that studied by Henneberg and Plunk (S.
Henneberg and G. Plunk, PRR 2024). We are also able to solve the existence
equation for flux surfaces analytically in the most general case by introducing
a special coordinate system. This will enable us to carry out an optimization
seeking to minimize the error in our GSE while obeying the flux surface
existence equation, which will allow us to find solutions outside the class of
hybrid devices. This will allow for a coarse-grained approximate search in the
space of quasisymmetric equilibria that should be faster than a conventional
stellarator optimization. Nevertheless, it would still be necessary to
fine-tune the approximate solutions using conventional tools to obtain a more
precise optimized equilibrium.

**Abstract**: Electro-optic modulators are fundamental components in atomic physics
experiments, including trapped-ion systems used in precision metrology and
quantum computing. To enable scalable photonic integration, we design and
analyze an integrated photonic electro-optic phase modulator and switch at 411
nm for ytterbium ($Yb^{+}$) ions using aluminum nitride (AlN) waveguides. We
employ finite element method (FEM) simulations to optimize optical confinement,
RF impedance matching, and electro-optic modulation efficiency. The phase
modulator achieves a DC $V_{\pi}L$ of 178 V cm for TE polarization. The
photonic switch, designed with a push-pull electrode configuration,
demonstrates a $V_{\pi}L$ of 24 V cm, enabling efficient operation at lower
voltages. These results highlight AlN as a candidate for ultraviolet photonic
integrated circuits, facilitating high-speed optical modulation for trapped-ion
applications.


### Self-Organizing Graph Reasoning Evolves into a Critical State for Continuous Discovery Through Structural-Semantic Dynamics
**Authors**: Markus J. Buehler

**PDF Url**: [2503.18852v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18852v1)

**Abstract**: We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems
spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic
discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and
semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which
semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay
is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes
at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy.
Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links
between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or
cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the
system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a
negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures,
reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish
clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive
complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability
and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the
underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used
by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and
practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic
capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how
model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.

**Abstract**: The isoscalar axial-vector form factor of the nucleon plays a key role in
understanding the electroweak interaction of nucleons. For the interpretation
of the spin structure of the nucleon the non-singlet isoscalar axial charge is
indispensable. Moreover, $G_A^{u+d-2s}(Q^2)$ together with the isovector and
singlet isoscalar form factors are needed for the flavor-decomposition of the
axial-vector form factor. Detailed knowledge of the flavor decomposition
facilitates extractions of Standard Model (SM) parameters from low energy
experiments such as the electroweak charge of the proton in the P2 experiment.
Here we present a lattice determination of $G_A^{u+d-2s}(Q^2)$ on $N_f=2+1$
$\mathcal{O}(a)$ improved Wilson fermions, with a full error budget concerning
extrapolations and interpolations to the continuum and infinite volume and
physical quark masses.


### Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole
**Authors**: Sergei Khlebnikov, Maxim Lyutikov

**Abstract**: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an
uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a
dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon > 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This
is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic
waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations
(involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous
media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the
initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the
role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of
both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual
Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c > 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike
Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is
spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov
emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z
/|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild
radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole
-- neutron star mergers.


### Connecting Gravity and Quantum Physics: Primordial Black Holes and Accelerated Evolution of the Universe

**PDF Url**: [2411.11047v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11047v3)

**Abstract**: This study presents a new framework to explore the fundamental relationship
between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the
fundamental role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the
concept of self-gravitating condensed light in the form of the experimentally
discovered quantum photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the
quantized gravitational, informational, thermodynamical, traditional, and other
attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics,
baryogenesis, the very early formation of galaxies, supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) and large-scale structures. Precise calculations have shown that
primordial protogalaxies with supermassive black holes at their centers of
gravity were formed before the recombination epoch. By solving issues like the
cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, dark matter and
dark energy, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and it's
impact to cosmology. In such a way PBHs serve as a bridge between quantum
theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that presented PBH
physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical issues,
paradoxes and "mysteries", such as the accelerated evolution of the Universe
established by JWST and other observations.


### Streaming Federated Learning with Markovian Data

**Abstract**: Federated learning (FL) is now recognized as a key framework for
communication-efficient collaborative learning. Most theoretical and empirical
studies, however, rely on the assumption that clients have access to
pre-collected data sets, with limited investigation into scenarios where
clients continuously collect data. In many real-world applications,
particularly when data is generated by physical or biological processes, client
data streams are often modeled by non-stationary Markov processes. Unlike
standard i.i.d. sampling, the performance of FL with Markovian data streams
remains poorly understood due to the statistical dependencies between client
samples over time. In this paper, we investigate whether FL can still support
collaborative learning with Markovian data streams. Specifically, we analyze
the performance of Minibatch SGD, Local SGD, and a variant of Local SGD with
momentum. We answer affirmatively under standard assumptions and smooth
non-convex client objectives: the sample complexity is proportional to the
inverse of the number of clients with a communication complexity comparable to
the i.i.d. scenario. However, the sample complexity for Markovian data streams
remains higher than for i.i.d. sampling.


## Diffusion
### A semantic communication-based workload-adjustable transceiver for wireless AI-generated content (AIGC) delivery

**Abstract**: With the significant advances in generative AI (GAI) and the proliferation of
mobile devices, providing high-quality AI-generated content (AIGC) services via
wireless networks is becoming the future direction. However, the primary
challenges of AIGC service delivery in wireless networks lie in unstable
channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational
resources. In this paper, we employ semantic communication (SemCom) in
diffusion-based GAI models to propose a Resource-aware wOrkload-adjUstable
TransceivEr (ROUTE) for AIGC delivery in dynamic wireless networks.
Specifically, to relieve the communication resource bottleneck, SemCom is
utilized to prioritize semantic information of the generated content. Then, to
improve computational resource utilization in both edge and local and reduce
AIGC semantic distortion in transmission, modified diffusion-based models are
applied to adjust the computing workload and semantic density in cooperative
content generation. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed ROUTE in
terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional AIGC approaches.


### Dual-domain Multi-path Self-supervised Diffusion Model for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction

**Abstract**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a vital diagnostic tool, but its
inherently long acquisition times reduce clinical efficiency and patient
comfort. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly diffusion models,
have improved accelerated MRI reconstruction. However, existing diffusion
models' training often relies on fully sampled data, models incur high
computational costs, and often lack uncertainty estimation, limiting their
clinical applicability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
framework, called Dual-domain Multi-path Self-supervised Diffusion Model
(DMSM), that integrates a self-supervised dual-domain diffusion model training
scheme, a lightweight hybrid attention network for the reconstruction diffusion
model, and a multi-path inference strategy, to enhance reconstruction accuracy,
efficiency, and explainability. Unlike traditional diffusion-based models, DMSM
eliminates the dependency on training from fully sampled data, making it more
practical for real-world clinical settings. We evaluated DMSM on two human MRI
datasets, demonstrating that it achieves favorable performance over several
supervised and self-supervised baselines, particularly in preserving fine
anatomical structures and suppressing artifacts under high acceleration
factors. Additionally, our model generates uncertainty maps that correlate
reasonably well with reconstruction errors, offering valuable clinically
interpretable guidance and potentially enhancing diagnostic confidence.


### Quantifying Climate Change Impacts on Renewable Energy Generation: A Super-Resolution Recurrent Diffusion Model

**Abstract**: Driven by global climate change and the ongoing energy transition, the
coupling between power supply capabilities and meteorological factors has
become increasingly significant. Over the long term, accurately quantifying the
power generation of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is
essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to
interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks
the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and
uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a
super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance
the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty.
The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that
generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling
mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value
using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic
(PV) power generation on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted
in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis
(ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate
pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM outperforms
existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate data.
Furthermore, the research highlights the estimation biases introduced when
low-resolution climate data is used for power conversion.


### MaRS: A Fast Sampler for Mean Reverting Diffusion based on ODE and SDE Solvers

**Abstract**: In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical
significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable
generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models,
while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the
stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image
conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast
samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion
requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain
high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR
Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time
SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated
with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist
of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network.
Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps.
Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream
parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity
prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high
sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image
restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR
Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.


### Thermalizer: Stable autoregressive neural emulation of spatiotemporal chaos
**Authors**: Chris Pedersen, Laure Zanna, Joan Bruna

**Published Date**: 2025-03-24

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-24

**PDF Url**: [2503.18731v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18731v1)

**Abstract**: Autoregressive surrogate models (or \textit{emulators}) of spatiotemporal
systems provide an avenue for fast, approximate predictions, with broad
applications across science and engineering. At inference time, however, these
models are generally unable to provide predictions over long time rollouts due
to accumulation of errors leading to diverging trajectories. In essence,
emulators operate out of distribution, and controlling the online distribution
quickly becomes intractable in large-scale settings. To address this
fundamental issue, and focusing on time-stationary systems admitting an
invariant measure, we leverage diffusion models to obtain an implicit estimator
of the score of this invariant measure. We show that this model of the score
function can be used to stabilize autoregressive emulator rollouts by applying
on-the-fly denoising during inference, a process we call
\textit{thermalization}. Thermalizing an emulator rollout is shown to extend
the time horizon of stable predictions by an order of magnitude in complex
systems exhibiting turbulent and chaotic behavior, opening up a novel
application of diffusion models in the context of neural emulation.
