**Abstract**: Accurate gradient sensing is crucial for efficient chemotaxis in noisy
environments, but the relationship between cell shape deformations and sensing
accuracy is not well understood. Using a theoretical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, we show that the receptor dispersion, quantified by cell
shape convex hull, fundamentally limits gradient sensing accuracy. Cells with a
concave shape and isotropic error space achieve optimal performance in gradient
detection. This concave shape, resulting from active protrusions or
contractions, can significantly improve gradient sensing accuracy at the cost
of increased energy expenditure. By balancing sensing accuracy and deformation
cost, we predict that a concave, three-branched shape as optimal for cells in
shallow gradients. To achieve efficient chemotaxis, our theory suggests that a
cell should adopt a repeating "run-and-expansion" cycle. Our theoretical
predictions align well with experimental observations, implying that the fast
amoeboid cell motion is optimized near the physical limit for chemotaxis. This
study highlights the crucial role of active cell shape deformation in
facilitating accurate chemotaxis.

**Abstract**: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex
branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in
automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched
structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is
difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While
existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable
Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear
Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs
create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot
be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To
address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched
Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework
that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework
to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at
junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient
computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate
dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments
demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and
generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Project

**Abstract**: The AKLT Hamiltonian is a particular instance of a general class of model
Hamiltonians defined in lattices with coordination $z$ where each site hosts a
spins $S=z/2$, interacting both with linear and non-linear exchange couplings.
In two dimensions, the AKLT model features a gap in the spectrum, and its
ground state is a valence bond solid state; that is an universal resource for
measurement based quantum computing, motivating the quest of physical systems
that realize this Hamiltonian. Given a finite-size system described with a
specific instance of this general class of models, we address the question of
how to asses if such system is a realization of the AKLT model using inelastic
tunnel spectroscopy implemented with scanning tunnel microscopy (IETS-STM). We
propose two approaches. First, in the case of a dimer, we show how to leverage
non-equilibrium IETS-STM to obtain the energies of all excited states, and
determine thereby the magnitude of both linear and non-linear exchange
interactions. Second, we explore how IETS can probe the in-gap excitations
associated to edge spins. In the AKLT limit, spins $S=3/2$ at the edge of the
lattice have coordination 2, giving rise to $S=1/2$ dangling spins that can be
probed with IETS. We propose a $S=1/2$ effective Hamiltonian to describe the
interactions between these dangling spins in the neighborhood of the AKLT
point, where their degeneracy lifted.

**Abstract**: We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are
collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a
simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic
microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with
other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and
the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms,
interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their
respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover,
the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of
the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on
various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations,
employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each
dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial
helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis,
whose origin we identify in a number of poorly fit polarization measurements.
Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the
CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation
measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal
detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's
preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from
the CMB-S4 experiment.

**Abstract**: Minkowski spacetime can be mapped by a series of projections in a
higher-dimensional spacetime to a Euclidean space, constituting a process of
Euclideanization shown here in detail for two dimensions. The result allows
regularizations and computations of integrals that appear in quantum field
theory (QFT) without performing the standard Wick rotation of time to imaginary
values. However, there is no physical spacetime transformation that produces a
Wick rotation. In avoiding this complexification process, the new
Euclidenization procedure has important advantages in the transformations of
the action principles, including fermionic fields and theories at constant
chemical potential. In all cases, complex-valued amplitudes of the form
$\exp(iS/\hbar)$ are mapped to real statistical weights $\exp(-S_{\rm
E}/\hbar)$ with a Euclidean action $S_{\rm E}$. The procedure is also amenable
to fields on curved background spacetimes as well as gravitational
interactions.

**Abstract**: The design and performance analysis of quantum error correction (QEC) codes
are often based on incoherent and independent noise models since it is easy to
simulate. However, these models fail to capture realistic hardware noise
sources, such as correlated errors (crosstalk), which can significantly impact
QEC code performance, especially when they occur between data and ancillary
qubits. In this paper, we systematically study various types of crosstalk noise
and quantify their effects on surface codes through memory and stability
experiments. Based on our findings, we introduce crosstalk-robust
implementations of QEC via redundant stabilizer checks and flag qubit designs.
In addition, we analyze logical crosstalk in an $[[n,k>1,d]]$ code block and
establish analytical conditions under which physical crosstalk does not lead to
logical crosstalk. Together, our analytical and numerical results shed light on
designing QEC codes that are robust against hardware-realistic noise, paving
the way for reliable experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum
computing.

**Abstract**: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing
approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles
governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful
interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities,
including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent
domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods
typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically
integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for
multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data
dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from
2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D
generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that
integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation
within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive
review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering
insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of
multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified
framework.


### Meshless Super-Resolution of Scattered Data via constrained RBFs and KNN-Driven Densification
**Authors**: Iacopo Tirelli, Miguel Alfonso Mendez, Andrea Ianiro, Stefano Discetti

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-06

**PDF Url**: [2503.04630v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04630v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a novel meshless method to achieve super-resolution from scattered
data obtained from sparse, randomly-positioned sensors such as the particle
tracers of particle tracking velocimetry. The method combines K-Nearest
Neighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN-PTV, Tirelli et al. 2023) with
meshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al. 2025)
and constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c-RBFs, Sperotto et al.
2022). The main idea is to use KNN-PTV to enhance the spatial resolution of
flow fields by blending data from \textit{locally similar} flow regions
available in the time series. This \textit{similarity} is assessed in terms of
statistical coherency with leading features, identified by meshless POD
directly on the scattered data without the need to first interpolate onto a
grid, but instead relying on RBFs to compute all the relevant inner products.
Lastly, the proposed approach uses the c-RBF on the denser scattered
distributions to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that
incorporates physical constraints. This combination is meshless because it does
not require the definition of a grid at any step of the calculation, thus
providing flexibility in handling complex geometries. The algorithm is
validated on 3D measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment covers three
key aspects: statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. The proposed method is
evaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN-PTV, and c-RBFs. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy, with an average error on the order of
11%, compared to 13-14% for the other methods. Additionally, the proposed
method achieves an increase in the cutoff frequency of approximately 3-4/D,
compared to the values observed in the competing approaches. Furthermore, it
shows nearly half the errors in low-order reconstructions.


### Physical, Empirical, and Conditional Inductive Possibility

**Abstract**: I argue that John Norton's notions of empirical, hypothetical, and
counterfactual possibility can be successfully used to analyze counterintuitive
examples of physical possibility and align better with modal intuitions of
practicing physicists. First, I clarify the relationship between Norton's
possibility notions and the received view of logical and physical possibility.
In particular, I argue that Norton's empirical, hypothetical, and
counterfactual possibility cannot coincide with the received view of physical
possibility; instead, the received view of physical possibility is a special
case of Norton's logical possibility. I illustrate my claims using examples
from Classical Mechanics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. I then
arrive at my conclusions by subsuming Norton's empirical, hypothetical, and
counterfactual possibilities under a single concept of conditional inductive
possibility and by analyzing the types and degrees of strengths that can be
associated with it.


### Impact of chaos on the excited-state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator

**Abstract**: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and
quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition
(ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature
of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of
the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two
distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are
useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that
protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how
chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the
nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the
cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of
theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever
larger nonlinearities.

**Abstract**: Monitoring the atmospheric dispersion of pollutants is increasingly critical
for environmental impact assessments. High-fidelity computational models are
often employed to simulate plume dynamics, guiding decision-making and
prioritizing resource deployment. However, such models can be prohibitively
expensive to simulate, as they require resolving turbulent flows at fine
spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, there are at least two distinct
dynamical regimes of interest in the plume: (i) the initial ejection of the
plume where turbulent mixing is generated by the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, and (ii) the ensuing turbulent diffusion and advection which is
often modeled by the Gaussian plume model. We address the challenge of modeling
the initial plume generation. Specifically, we propose a data-driven framework
that identifies a reduced-order analytical model for plume dynamics -- directly
from video data. We extract a time series of plume center and edge points from
video snapshots and evaluate different regressions based to their extrapolation
performance to generate a time series of coefficients that characterize the
plume's overall direction and spread. We regress to a sinusoidal model inspired
by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the edge points in order to identify
the plume's dispersion and vorticity. Overall, this reduced-order modeling
framework provides a data-driven and lightweight approach to capture the
dominant features of the initial nonlinear point-source plume dynamics,
agnostic to plume type and starting only from video. The resulting model is a
pre-cursor to standard models such as the Gaussian plume model and has the
potential to enable rapid assessment and evaluation of critical environmental
hazards, such as methane leaks, chemical spills, and pollutant dispersal from
smokestacks.

**Abstract**: Machine learning systems struggle with robustness, under subpopulation
shifts. This problem becomes especially pronounced in scenarios where only a
subset of attribute combinations is observed during training -a severe form of
subpopulation shift, referred as compositional shift. To address this problem,
we ask the following question: Can we improve the robustness by training on
synthetic data, spanning all possible attribute combinations? We first show
that training of conditional diffusion models on limited data lead to incorrect
underlying distribution. Therefore, synthetic data sampled from such models
will result in unfaithful samples and does not lead to improve performance of
downstream machine learning systems. To address this problem, we propose CoInD
to reflect the compositional nature of the world by enforcing conditional
independence through minimizing Fisher's divergence between joint and marginal
distributions. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated by CoInD is
faithful and this translates to state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy on
compositional shift tasks on CelebA.

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful
approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy
optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive
to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE,
on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high
memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal
performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of
the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and
using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To
address these challenges, we systematically analyze the
efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose
leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP
combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling
multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the
robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.
Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on
various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between
computational efficiency and performance.


### The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two
competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models.
However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with
visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic
understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid
framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through
coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations:
(1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D
discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a
$\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates
semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming
diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos.
Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the
VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models
Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Keling, and
Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in
long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field. Our
demo can be viewed at https://landiff.github.io/.
