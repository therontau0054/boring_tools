**Abstract**: In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become
physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase
space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter
localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts
that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any
quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum
corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and
quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum
representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do
so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined.
We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of
$4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement
entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a
semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the
semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum
informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general
states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement
entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.

**Abstract**: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena,
such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm
of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials
based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this
system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,
if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues
of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in
the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the
location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear
effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the
Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the
\textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole
as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both
the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes.
These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of
black hole physics in a laboratory setting.

**PDF Url**: [2507.16780v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16780v1)

**Abstract**: We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black
hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian
distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the
physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of
Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum
tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to
a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is
violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation
of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important
for observational signatures.

**Abstract**: The observed spectra in the collisions of neon (Ne) projectiles of 1.8 and
2.1 MeV with an aluminum target (Al) have been successfully segregated from
strong bremsstrahlung backgrounds and then analyzed by comparing the transition
energies and rates with the theoretical predictions of the flexible atomic
structure code and the general purpose relativistic atomic structure package.
The spectra contain K{\alpha}, Kh{\alpha} , and K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines. The
K{\alpha}{\alpha} emissions are due to two-electron one-photon transitions.
Interestingly, the K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines in projectile ions are only seen
with 1.8 MeV energy. In contrast, the K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines in the target
ions are also well observed with 2.1 MeV energy. Surprisingly, the Al K x-ray
line intensities are strongly suppressed, and the K{\alpha}{\alpha} line
intensities are unexpectedly enhanced. The underlying physical process is found
to be the photoionization caused by intense bremsstrahlung radiation. This
photoionization process converts most of the singly ionized K shell states
(\approx 82\% at 2.1 MeV) to doubly ionized K shell states. This phenomenon is
silently present on many occasions. We take some of such events to validate
this remarkable finding. This bremsstrahlung radiation induced secondary
ionization process stands as an eye opening incidence to the plasma physics,
astronomy and astrophysics communities; may revolutionize these fields of
research.

**PDF Url**: [2501.01050v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01050v3)

**Abstract**: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental
challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary
processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework
for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds have recently been reported
for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response
equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into
spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that
response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and
dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem and recently developed non-equilibrium linear
response relations. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them
to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of
the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical
significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response
properties from sampling unperturbed trajectories, offering significant
advantages over traditional finite-difference approaches for estimating
response properties of complex networks and biological systems far from
equilibrium.

**PDF Url**: [2507.16760v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16760v1)

**Abstract**: We propose high-spin $\Sigma$-state polar molecules assembled from ultracold
atoms to probe charge-parity violating physics beyond the Standard Model. We
identify YbCr as a prime candidate to search for the electric dipole moment of
the electron. We show that the combination of relativistic ytterbium and
high-spin chromium, amenable to magneto-association, leads to molecules with
easy-to-polarize parity doublets and large intramolecular electric fields.
Based on \textit{ab initio} results for molecular constants, we predict a
sensitivity of $\delta d_{\textrm{e}}= ( 6 \times 10^{-31} /
\sqrt{n_{\mathrm{day}}})\,e\,\mathrm{cm}$ via standard spin-precession
measurements, we assess the experimental feasibility, and discuss potential
extensions to more advanced quantum control as well as searches of the nuclear
magnetic quadrupole moment. This work paves the way to next-generation searches
for new physics with ultracold molecules in both the leptonic and hadronic
sectors.


### Many-Body Physics from Spin-Phonon Coupling in Rydberg Atom Arrays

**PDF Url**: [2507.16751v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16751v1)

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established
Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body
physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each
atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively
frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of
novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$
symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the
consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give
rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that
this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit,
as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the
violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is
suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily
testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.

**Abstract**: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.


### Notes from the bulk
**Authors**: Erica Bertolini

**Published Date**: 2025-07-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2507.16744v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16744v1)

**Abstract**: The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a
boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new
physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the
formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge
modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the
bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs
with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be
associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in
order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the
prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall
systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a
physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum
Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have
non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining
symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the
boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which
also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a
possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton
quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the
algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never
proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter,
elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this
Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar
gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these
quasiparticles.

**Abstract**: Three-dimensional (3D) crystals offer a route to scale up trapped ion systems
for quantum sensing and quantum simulation applications. However, engineering
coherent spin-motion couplings and effective spin-spin interactions in large
crystals poses technical challenges associated with decoherence and prolonged
timescales to generate appreciable entanglement. Here, we explore the
possibility to speed up these interactions in 3D crystals via parametric
amplification. We derive a general Hamiltonian for the parametric amplification
of spin-motion coupling that is applicable to crystals of any dimension in both
rf Paul traps and Penning traps. Unlike in lower dimensional crystals, we find
that the ability to faithfully (uniformly) amplify the spin-spin interactions
in 3D crystals depends on the physical implementation of the spin-motion
coupling. We consider the light-shift (LS) gate, and the so-called
phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gates, and
find that only the latter gate can be faithfully amplified in general 3D
crystals. We discuss a situation where non-uniform amplification can be
advantageous. We also reconsider the impact of counter-rotating terms on
parametric amplification and find that they are not as detrimental as previous
studies suggest.


## Diffusion
### PRISM: High-Resolution & Precise Counterfactual Medical Image Generation using Language-guided Stable Diffusion
**Authors**: Amar Kumar, Anita Kriz, Mohammad Havaei, Tal Arbel

**Published Date**: 2025-02-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2503.00196v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00196v2)

**Abstract**: Developing reliable and generalizable deep learning systems for medical
imaging faces significant obstacles due to spurious correlations, data
imbalances, and limited text annotations in datasets. Addressing these
challenges requires architectures that are robust to the unique complexities
posed by medical imaging data. Rapid advancements in vision-language foundation
models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be
adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework
that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided
medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates
unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the
medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of
specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics. Through
extensive evaluation, we show how PRISM advances counterfactual generation and
enables the development of more robust downstream classifiers for clinically
deployable solutions. To facilitate broader adoption and research, we make our
code publicly available at https://github.com/Amarkr1/PRISM.

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2507.16579v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16579v1)

**Abstract**: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale
image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows
significant advantages over other methods. The source code is available at

### EarthCrafter: Scalable 3D Earth Generation via Dual-Sparse Latent Diffusion
**Authors**: Shang Liu, Chenjie Cao, Chaohui Yu, Wen Qian, Jing Wang, Fan Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-07-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2507.16535v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16535v1)

**Abstract**: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.


### FlowEdit: Inversion-Free Text-Based Editing Using Pre-Trained Flow Models
**Authors**: Vladimir Kulikov, Matan Kleiner, Inbar Huberman-Spiegelglas, Tomer Michaeli

**Published Date**: 2024-12-11

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2412.08629v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08629v2)

**Abstract**: Editing real images using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow
model often involves inverting the image into its corresponding noise map.
However, inversion by itself is typically insufficient for obtaining
satisfactory results, and therefore many methods additionally intervene in the
sampling process. Such methods achieve improved results but are not seamlessly
transferable between model architectures. Here, we introduce FlowEdit, a
text-based editing method for pre-trained T2I flow models, which is
inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic. Our method constructs an
ODE that directly maps between the source and target distributions
(corresponding to the source and target text prompts) and achieves a lower
transport cost than the inversion approach. This leads to state-of-the-art
results, as we illustrate with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. Code and examples
are available on the project's webpage.


### Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model
**Authors**: Jintao Zhang, Zirui Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Shilong Zhang, Tingyue Pan, Yitong zhou, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie

**Abstract**: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia
and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and
increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by
event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across
diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal
language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse
hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage
involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented
through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns
associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the
original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish
normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each
patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding
physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model
to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding
clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into
structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on
two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established
baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability
in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to
promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.


## Quantitative Finance

**Authors**: Jakub Michańków, Paweł Sakowski, Robert Ślepaczuk

**Published Date**: 2025-07-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2507.16548v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16548v1)

**Abstract**: The proper design and architecture of testing of machine learning models,
especially in their application to quantitative finance problems, is crucial.
The most important in this process is selecting an adequate loss function used
for training, validation, estimation purposes, and tuning of hyperparameters.
Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and
cryptocurrency assets, we introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL)
function which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used
in algorithmic investment strategies. The MADL function results are compared
for Transformer and LSTM models and we show that almost in every case
Transformer results are significantly better than those obtained with LSTM.
