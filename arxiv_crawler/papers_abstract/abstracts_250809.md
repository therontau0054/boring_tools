**Abstract**: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

**Abstract**: We present a study of the high-pressure behaviour Bi14WO24, a high oxide ion
conductor member of the Bi2O3-WO3 binary system. The tetragonal polymorph of
Bi14WO24 was studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder
X-ray diffraction. It was found that in contrast to isostructural Bi14CrO24 and
Bi14MoO24 which experience a phase transition around 5 GPa, in our study
Bi14WO24 undergoes an irreversible chemical decomposition into Bi2O3 and WO3 at
2.85(5) GPa. The pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters of Bi14WO24
was also determined, and hence the linear compressibility along different axes
and room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state were derived. Bulk
modulus of tetragonal Bi14WO24 was found to be 49.8(2.6) GPa, and the linear
compressibility of the two crystallographic axes, \k{appa}a and \k{appa}c were
6.94(2) 10-3 GPa-1 and = 3.73(1) 10-3 GPa-1, respectively. The pressure induced
decomposition can be attributed to the favourable increasing density of the
system to accommodate the pressure induced stress.

**Abstract**: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.


### The Mpemba Effect in Pure Water Has a Stochastic Origin. Experimental and Theoretical Resolution of the Paradox
**Authors**: Andrei A. Klimov, Alexei V. Finkelstein

**Published Date**: 2025-08-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.05607v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05607v1)

**Abstract**: The "Mpemba effect" is the name given to the assertion that hot water freezes
quicker than cold water1 or, in a modern and more general form, that the system
that is initially more distant from its equilibrium state comes to this state
earlier2. This counterintuitive statement seems to breach fundamental
thermodynamic and kinetic laws; however, numerous experiments3-10 with
classical and quantum systems demonstrate this paradoxical Mpemba effect,
leading to extensive discssions in prominent scientific jornals2,5,9,12-14.
However, the fundamental physical mechanisms behind this effect have remained
elusive14. Here we performed the water freezing experiments under carefully
controlled conditions, and found that the Mpemba effect only occurred when the
freezer temperature was very close to the temperature of ice nucleation. In
this case, the range of freezing times for both hot and cold water was so great
that it exceeded the delayed cooling of the initially hotter liquid, and
therefore sometimes the hot water froze before the cold water. Our theoretical
analysis of this fact shows that the Mpemba paradox associated with water
freezing is rooted in the stochastic nature of ice nucleation, typical of
first-order phase transitions. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point
for reconsidering the famous Mpemba paradox in water and other systems
undergoing similar phase transitions.


### Quench dynamics of entanglement entropy under projective charge measurements: the free fermion case
**Authors**: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese

**Published Date**: 2025-08-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.05588v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05588v1)

**Abstract**: We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of
the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems.
In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved
charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the
entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We
compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is
an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the
effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically
performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for
the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical
interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct
types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately
as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is
independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance
of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on
the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual
realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible
outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry
resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and
are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the N\'eel initial state.


### Quantum effects in rotating thermal states on anti-de Sitter space-time
**Authors**: Jacob C. Thompson, Elizabeth Winstanley

**Published Date**: 2025-05-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2505.05448v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05448v2)

**Abstract**: We study the stress-energy tensor of a massless, conformally coupled, quantum
scalar field in a rigidly-rotating thermal state on three- and four-dimensional
anti-de Sitter space-time. We first find the stress-energy tensor using
relativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless
bosons. We then compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the scalar
field in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from
relativistic kinetic theory.


### Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires
**Authors**: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur

**Published Date**: 2025-01-24

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2501.14410v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14410v3)

**Abstract**: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in
ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral
quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. adding charge and current
fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are
characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the
entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids.
This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of
electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a
result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards
ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a
useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We
address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an
algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a
potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite
fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the
Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.


### Efficient optimization of expensive black-box simulators via marginal means, with application to neutrino detector design
**Authors**: Hwanwoo Kim, Simon Mak, Ann-Kathrin Schuetz, Alan Poon

**Published Date**: 2025-08-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.01834v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01834v2)

**Abstract**: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly
used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,
the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require
hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over
a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs
$\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated
inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''
(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address
this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)
approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$
that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently
inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can
select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.
Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with
unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM
estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization
rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,
thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a
practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive
Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector
optimization in nuclear physics.


### Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets
**Authors**: Tongshuai Zhu, Di Zhou, Huaiqiang Wang, Jiawei Ruan

**Published Date**: 2025-08-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.02542v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02542v2)

**Abstract**: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from
ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in
condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear
magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings
with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts
exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings remain largely unexplored. Here, based on
symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be
induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model
analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly
polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces
both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet
odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced
antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed
Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of
MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new
class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced
magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.


### Massive Spinor Helicity Amplitudes, Cross Sections, and Coalescence
**Authors**: Camille Gomez-Laberge

**Published Date**: 2025-08-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.05539v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05539v1)

**Abstract**: We examine recent advancements of the spinor helicity formalism of massive
particles. Technical aspects about the formulation of massive helicity spinors
are presented in detail to analyze the projective-geometry kinematics of
helicity spinors as well as the diagrammatical and analytical structure of
their interactions. Two new methods for calculating massive cross sections are
derived and tested on Bhabha and Compton processes: a quasi-high-energy limit
and an assembly of partial cross sections. The acquisition of mass, where
ultrarelativistic amplitudes coalesce at low energy, is given a physical
interpretation as the localization of particle worldlines in twistor theory. By
subsuming the spinor helicity formalism in this way, both spacetime and
particle content can emerge from null, lightlike, and timelike twistors.


## Diffusion
### Personalized Safety Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yu Lei, Jinbin Bai, Qingyu Shi, Aosong Feng, Kaidong Yu

**Published Date**: 2025-08-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.01151v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01151v2)

**Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at
https://m-e-agi-lab.github.io/PSAlign/.


### MolSnap: Snap-Fast Molecular Generation with Latent Variational Mean Flow
**Authors**: Md Atik Ahamed, Qiang Ye, Qiang Cheng

**Published Date**: 2025-08-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2508.05411v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05411v1)

**Abstract**: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.


### CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection
**Authors**: Byeongchan Lee, John Won, Seunghyun Lee, Jinwoo Shin

**Published Date**: 2025-06-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-07

**PDF Url**: [2506.11772v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11772v2)

**Abstract**: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.


### UNCAGE: Contrastive Attention Guidance for Masked Generative Transformers in Text-to-Image Generation
**Authors**: Wonjun Kang, Byeongkeun Ahn, Minjae Lee, Kevin Galim, Seunghyuk Oh, Hyung Il Koo, Nam Ik Cho

**Published Date**: 2025-08-07

**Abstract**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at
https://github.com/furiosa-ai/uncage.
