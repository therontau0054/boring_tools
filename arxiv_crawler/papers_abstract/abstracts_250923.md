**Abstract**: Heavily doping graphene by intercalation can raise its Fermi level near an
extended van Hove singularity, potentially inducing correlated electronic
phases. Intercalation also modifies the band structure: dopants may hybridize
with carbon orbitals and order into $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ or $2\times2$
superstructures, introducing periodic potentials that fold the graphene $\pi$
bands. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy further shows a pronounced
flattening of the conduction band near the M points, producing higher-order van
Hove singularities. These effects depend strongly on the dopant species and
substrate, with implications for both many-body physics and transport. We
construct effective tight-binding models that incorporate dopant ordering,
carbon-dopant hybridization, and $\pi$-band renormalization. Model parameters
are obtained from density functional theory and reproduce dispersions observed
in photoemission experiments. Using these models, we compute the optical
conductivity and identify characteristic signatures associated with dopant
ordering and hybridization. Our results provide a framework to interpret
experimental spectra and to probe the superlattice symmetry of highly doped
monolayer graphene.

**Abstract**: Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter
physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials.
The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated
some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning
the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate
doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity
upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a
pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and
spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a
recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures.
Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops
upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track
this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic
anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped
metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of
spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform
in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this
signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and
doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped
metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and
suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in
future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum
simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.


### Neuromorphic Intelligence

**Abstract**: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency,
flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike
conventional digital approaches, which suffer from the Von Neumann bottleneck
and depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems
exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude
greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from a wide range of
disciplines, including artificial intelligence, physics, chemistry, biology,
neuroscience, cognitive science and materials science, neuromorphic computing
promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and
widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying
theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue
that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in
differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference,
learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this
framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while
differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems
that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way
toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises
from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and
sustainability of AI.


### Exploring molecular supersolidity via exact and mean-field theories: single microwave shielding
**Authors**: Tiziano Arnone Cardinale, Thomas Bland, Stephanie M. Reimann

**PDF Url**: [2509.18051v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18051v1)

**Abstract**: Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful
platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic
interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic
molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective
interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our
approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent
accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces
direction-dependent superfluidity - absent in cylindrically symmetric systems -
enabling tunable anisotropy and potential applications in directional quantum
sensing. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can
be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore,
we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly
influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and
continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low
entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double
shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that
single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the
groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.


### Global stability of ghostly field theories: Classical scattering in $(N+1)$ dimensions
**Authors**: Aaron Held

**Published Date**: 2025-09-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-22

**PDF Url**: [2509.18049v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18049v1)

**Abstract**: We review results on small-data global stability and highlight their
applicability to classical interacting scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic
terms (ghosts). Further, we present a one-parameter family of numerical
scattering solutions under the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. We
thereby identify classical ghostly field theories with polynomial interaction
potentials for which small-data global stability apparently extends to
large-data global stability, i.e., global stability for all compactly supported
initial data. These global stability results support an underlying physical
mechanism by which the ghost instability can be quenched due to dominant
self-interactions, at least in classical physics.


### Analysis of polymerized superconducting circuits

**PDF Url**: [2509.18016v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18016v1)

**Abstract**: We apply polymer quantization, a quantization technique sometimes used in
high energy physics, to several superconducting circuits including: transmons,
transmission line resonators, and LC circuits. In the case of transmon qubits
and transmission line resonators, experimental predictions are very close to
what is found with canonical quantization, though in this approach constant
charge offsets can be interpreted as quantization ambiguities. In the case of
LC circuits, polymer quantization predicts nonlinearities which are not present
in the canonical approach. Based on this analysis we design and analyze a qubit
which uses a meander inductor instead of a Josephson junction. Implications for
qubit performance and fabrication are discussed. Given a choice for an
effective phase operator, relevant parameters such as anharmonicity, frequency,
and dispersive shifts are calculated for this meander inductor based qubit.


### Building Transparency in Deep Learning-Powered Network Traffic Classification: A Traffic-Explainer Framework
**Authors**: Riya Ponraj, Ram Durairajan, Yu Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-09-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-22

**PDF Url**: [2509.18007v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18007v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the
performance and efficiency of traffic classification in networking systems.
However, the lack of transparency in their predictions and decision-making has
made network operators reluctant to deploy DL-based solutions in production
networks. To tackle this challenge, we propose Traffic-Explainer, a
model-agnostic and input-perturbation-based traffic explanation framework. By
maximizing the mutual information between predictions on original traffic
sequences and their masked counterparts, Traffic-Explainer automatically
uncovers the most influential features driving model predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Traffic-Explainer improves upon existing
explanation methods by approximately 42%. Practically, we further apply
Traffic-Explainer to identify influential features and demonstrate its enhanced
transparency across three critical tasks: application classification, traffic
localization, and network cartography. For the first two tasks,
Traffic-Explainer identifies the most decisive bytes that drive predicted
traffic applications and locations, uncovering potential vulnerabilities and
privacy concerns. In network cartography, Traffic-Explainer identifies
submarine cables that drive the mapping of traceroute to physical path,
enabling a traceroute-informed risk analysis.


### Gravity from thermodynamics in vacuum: Lorentz invariance and the role of Bel-Robinson tensor
**Authors**: Ana Alonso-Serrano, Marek Liška

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-22

**PDF Url**: [2411.07856v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07856v2)

**Abstract**: Thermodynamics of local causal horizons have been shown to encode the
information necessary to derive the equations governing the gravitational
dynamics. We have previously shown that, in the presence of matter, this
derivation further implies quantum phenomenological corrections to
gravitational dynamics. Herein, we study whether similar corrections also occur
in vacuum. We show that, under the assumptions of locality and local Lorentz
invariance of physics, the vacuum dynamics is prescribed by the Einstein
equations. We also discuss an alternative paradigm which assumes the existence
of a preferred direction of time (much like in Einstein-aether or
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity). Then, we find an modified gravitational dynamics
in which Ricci curvature is sourced by Bel-Robinson super-energy.


### Hybrid Electromagnetic Calorimeter Module: Enhanced Performance through Integration of Silicon Pixel Layer into Scintillator Design
**Authors**: Jia-Le Fei, Ao Yuan, Chang-Heng Huang, Liu-Pan An, Ji-Ke Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-09-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-22

**PDF Url**: [2509.17997v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17997v1)

**Abstract**: This study constructs a hybrid module with a multi-material collaborative
detection architecture by integrating silicon pixel layers into the
longitudinally segmented scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter module and
optimizes the placement of the silicon layers. The module utilizes the
pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure
sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining
its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework
combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized
approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and
performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance
enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56\% for position
resolution and 26\% for time resolution, respectively. These advancements also
lead to significant increase of physics sensitivity, especially for physics
channels with low-energy photons, for instance, a 16\% boost in signal
significance for $D^{*0}$ from the $B^-\rightarrow D^{*0}(\rightarrow D^0
\gamma)\pi^-$ decay


### Gravity from equilibrium thermodynamics of stretched light cones

**PDF Url**: [2509.08566v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08566v2)

**Abstract**: This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of
stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating
observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the
Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to
fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously
predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the
equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the
SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation
to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its
surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational
dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of
equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can
identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.


## Diffusion
### Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Sudhanshu Agrawal, Risheek Garrepalli, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Christopher Lott, Fatih Porikli

**Abstract**: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly
higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs
often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at
every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present
Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by
$\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output
distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying
ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes
draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an
auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and
eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To
structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph
which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise
nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To
further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an
efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines
high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling
increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup
achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent
innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and
multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel
decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of
these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.


### Efficient Neural SDE Training using Wiener-Space Cubature
**Authors**: Luke Snow, Vikram Krishnamurthy

**Published Date**: 2025-02-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-22

**PDF Url**: [2502.12395v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12395v3)

**Abstract**: A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and
diffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for
neural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network)
parameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on
infinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods
to efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with
respect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to
estimate the gradient expectation. In this work we introduce a novel training
technique which bypasses and improves upon this Monte-Carlo simulation; we
extend results in the theory of Wiener space cubature to approximate the
expected objective functional value by a weighted sum of functional evaluations
of deterministic ODE solutions. Our main mathematical contribution enabling
this approximation is an extension of cubature bounds to the setting of
Lipschitz-nonlinear functionals acting on path-space. Our resulting
constructive algorithm allows for more computationally efficient training along
several lines. First, it circumvents Brownian motion simulation and enables the
use of efficient parallel ODE solvers, thus decreasing the complexity of
path-functional evaluation. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that
the number of paths required to achieve a given (expected loss functional
oracle value) approximation can be reduced in this deterministic cubature
regime. Specifically, we show that under reasonable regularity assumptions we
can observe a O(1/n) convergence rate, where n is the number of path
evaluations; in contrast with the standard O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of naive
Monte-Carlo or the O(log(n)^d /n) rate of quasi-Monte-Carlo.


### Prepare Before You Act: Learning From Humans to Rearrange Initial States
**Authors**: Yinlong Dai, Andre Keyser, Dylan P. Losey

**Abstract**: Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective across a wide range of
manipulation tasks. However, IL policies often struggle when faced with
out-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a
previously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,
extensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and
generalizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical
initial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task
execution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier
to grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp
their target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same
capability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their
given policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which
are outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses
so that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we
show that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out
the given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET
algorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic
teleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what
simplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into
robot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other
baselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust
task execution with equal amounts of total training data. See videos at our

### ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Composable Diffusion

**PDF Url**: [2509.17941v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17941v1)

**Abstract**: This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic
environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the
combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can
include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification
combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example,
"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists
of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of
the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the
intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its
constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.
Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then
composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of
specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for
demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training
procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for
dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the
base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world
experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions
by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of
specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based
policies and costmap composing baselines. Videos and additional materials can
be found on the project page: https://amrl.cs.utexas.edu/ComposableNav/


### Optimizing Inference in Transformer-Based Models: A Multi-Method Benchmark

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-22

**PDF Url**: [2509.17894v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17894v1)

**Abstract**: Efficient inference is a critical challenge in deep generative modeling,
particularly as diffusion models grow in capacity and complexity. While
increased complexity often improves accuracy, it raises compute costs, latency,
and memory requirements. This work investigates techniques such as pruning,
quantization, knowledge distillation, and simplified attention to reduce
computational overhead without impacting performance. The study also explores
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to further enhance efficiency. These
experiments provide insights into optimizing inference for the state-of-the-art
Fast Diffusion Transformer (fast-DiT) model.

**Abstract**: The estimation of fill probabilities for trade orders represents a key
ingredient in the optimization of algorithmic trading strategies. It is bound
by the complex dynamics of financial markets with inherent uncertainties, and
the limitations of models aiming to learn from multivariate financial time
series that often exhibit stochastic properties with hidden temporal patterns.
In this paper, we focus on algorithmic responses to trade inquiries in the
corporate bond market and investigate fill probability estimation errors of
common machine learning models when given real production-scale intraday trade
event data, transformed by a quantum algorithm running on IBM Heron processors,
as well as on noiseless quantum simulators for comparison. We introduce a
framework to embed these quantum-generated data transforms as a decoupled
offline component that can be selectively queried by models in low-latency
institutional trade optimization settings. A trade execution backtesting method
is employed to evaluate the fill prediction performance of these models in
relation to their input data. We observe a relative gain of up to ~ 34% in
out-of-sample test scores for those models with access to quantum
hardware-transformed data over those using the original trading data or
transforms by noiseless quantum simulation. These empirical results suggest
that the inherent noise in current quantum hardware contributes to this effect
and motivates further studies. Our work demonstrates the emerging potential of
quantum computing as a complementary explorative tool in quantitative finance
and encourages applied industry research towards practical applications in
trading.
