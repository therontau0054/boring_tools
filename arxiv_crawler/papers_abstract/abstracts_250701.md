**Abstract**: The neutrino telescopes have firmly established the existence of
ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos offer a
unique probe of neutrino self-interactions. This work investigates how the
self-interacting neutrinos, mediated by scalar bosons, inject energy into the
medium through radiative scattering with the cosmic neutrino background,
leaving an imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The
energy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\times10^4\lesssim
z\lesssim2\times10^6$ and $ z\lesssim5\times10^4$, leads to $\mu$-type and
$y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively. Using observational
constraints from Cosmic Background Explorer/Far Infrared Absolute
Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) and projected sensitivities from Primordial
Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) experiments for $\mu$-type and $y$-type CMB
distortions, we derive the stringent upper bounds on the self-interaction
coupling strength as a function of mediator mass for neutrino interactions. We
focus on flavor-specific self-interaction related to muon neutrinos and sub-GeV
mass mediators ($m_{\phi}$). We find the upper bound on the self-interaction
coupling strength to be $\sim 3.1\times 10^{-5}$ for the muon neutrino,
considering UHE muon neutrino energy to be 1 PeV and PIXIE projected upper
bounds on $\mu$-type CMB spectral distortion. The bound remains constant till
the mediator mass reaches the center of mass energy, and after that, it gets
relaxed and becomes proportional to the mediator mass. We have also compared
our results with existing bounds in the literature. Our findings indicate that
CMB spectral distortion could play a decisive role in exploring neutrino
physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and future missions like
PIXIE can provide valuable insights.

**Abstract**: The Three-Higgs-Doublet Model (3HDM) extends the Standard Model by
introducing two additional scalar doublets, leading to a rich spectrum of new
particles: three neutral CP-even Higgs bosons ($h_1$, $H_2$, $H_3$), two
neutral CP-odd Higgs bosons ($A_2$, $A_3$), and two charged Higgs bosons
($H_2^+$, $H_3^+$). In this work, we present a phenomenological study of the
3HDM at the future International Linear Collider (ILC) with a center-of-mass
energy of $\sqrt{s} = 1000\,\text{GeV}$. Applying a comprehensive set of
theoretical and experimental constraints, we identify promising new physics
signals with sufficiently large production cross-sections. Our analysis shows
that $e^+e^- \to H_2 A_2$, $e^+e^- \to H_2 H_2 Z$, $A_2 A_2 Z$, $H_2 H_2^{\pm}
W^{\mp}$, $A_2 H_2^{\pm} W^{\mp}$ and $H_1 H_2 A_2$ are among the most
sensitive channels to probe this extended Higgs sector. We demonstrate that a
future ILC would offer a powerful platform to test these interactions and
discover these heavier Higgs bosons thus providing evidence of physics beyond
the Standard Model.

**Abstract**: Microwave drives are essential for implementing control and readout
operations in superconducting quantum circuits. However, increasing the drive
strength eventually leads to unwanted state transitions which limit the speed
and fidelity of such operations. In this work, we systematically investigate
such transitions in a fixed-frequency qubit subjected to microwave drives
spanning a 9 GHz frequency range. We identify the physical origins of these
transitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy
exchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark
shifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to
the circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the
drive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while
transferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level
system (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation,
complemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device,
accurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS. Our
results provide a comprehensive classification of these transitions and offer
mitigation strategies through informed choices of drive frequency as well as
improved circuit design.

**Abstract**: Wave interference has historically relied on scattering objects placed within
the wave domain. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new mechanism: scatterless
interference induced by a lattice of subsurface phonon motion beneath a smooth
wall interfacing with a transitioning boundary-layer flow. The subsurface
consists of a wall-parallel lattice of wall-normal frequency-dependent phononic
structural units, each designed to respond to local flow perturbations in an
out-of-phase manner, suppressing them at the point of interaction.
Collectively, the lattice induces interference effects that cause the kinetic
energy of flow instabilities to decay downstream, thereby delaying
laminar-to-turbulent transition. To guide the design of the phononic subsurface
lattice, a Bloch-wave unit-cell analysis is developed for the flow
perturbations, and direct numerical simulations validate the concept. This work
establishes scatterless interference as a distinct physical phenomenon and
represents a paradigm shift in the design of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic
surfaces--moving beyond streamlined shaping to leveraging subsurface phonon
engineering for drag reduction and enhanced performance.

**Abstract**: Human mobility in cities is shaped not only by visible structures such as
highways, rivers, and parks but also by invisible barriers rooted in
socioeconomic segregation, uneven access to amenities, and administrative
divisions. Yet identifying and quantifying these barriers at scale and their
relative importance on people's movements remains a major challenge. Neural
embedding models, originally developed for language, offer a powerful way to
capture the complexity of human mobility from large-scale data. Here, we apply
this approach to 25.4 million observed trajectories across 11 major U.S.
cities, learning mobility embeddings that reveal how people move through urban
space. These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places,
one that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to
detect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but
behaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these
barriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and
residential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are
concentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time
periods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary
but still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that
individuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting
hours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and
higher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial,
social, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a
scalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications
in planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis.

**Abstract**: In the wake of a rash of executive orders and administrative actions aimed at
shaping the scale, scope, and focus of the scientific enterprise in the United
States during the second Trump Presidency, we have undertaken a survey of
members of the American Physical Society, the country's pre-eminent physics
professional society to investigate their needs, interests, and priorities, and
how their interests may differ from organizational leadership's priorities.
This report provides detail on the context for the creation and implementation
of the survey, as well as articulating results and some common themes found in
responses. Broadly, our informal survey of APS members revealed that a majority
of respondents perceive that the Society supports them, cares about their needs
as physicists, and is communicating reliably and transparently. However, a
sizeable proportion of respondents -- up to 30\% -- harbor concerns about the
organization's actions, its prioritization of member needs over corporate
interests, or its willingness to listen to members. In addition, a strong
majority -- over two-thirds of respondents -- articulated a desire for more
concrete and personal support from APS. While we acknowledge that the Society
cannot be all things to all people, the results of our work lead us to the
concern that there may indeed be a disconnect between the APS envisioned by
those at the top of the organization and those who fill its ranks.


### Dark matter as the source of neutrino mass: theory overview and experimental prospects
**Authors**: Ivania M. Ávila, Anirban Karan, Sanjoy Mandal, Soumya Sadhukhan, José W. F. Valle

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-30

**PDF Url**: [2506.24027v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24027v1)

**Abstract**: We review theoretical frameworks in which small neutrino masses arise
radiatively through interactions with a dark sector that also accounts for
cosmological dark matter. A prototypical example is provided by scotogenic
schemes, that extend the inert Higgs doublet model. We outline their key
features and limitations, including possible completions, such as the revamped
setup. The phenomenological signatures of both fermionic and bosonic scotogenic
dark matter are discussed, along with scoto-seesaw models that merge scotogenic
and seesaw mechanisms, and scenarios where the dark sector triggers a low-scale
seesaw. These frameworks can accommodate dark matter as either Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or Feebly Interacting Massive Particles
(FIMPs). While hidden dark sector models are inherently difficult to test
experimentally, those based on visible dark sectors offer clear predictions
that could be confirmed -- or ruled out -- by forthcoming dark matter searches,
collider experiments, and lepton flavor violation studies.


### Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension
**Authors**: Kyungmin Lee, Sunkyu Yu, Seungwoo Yu, Jiyong Kang, Wonhyeong Choi, Sumin Park, Taehyun Kim

**Published Date**: 2025-06-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-30

**PDF Url**: [2506.24020v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24020v1)

**Abstract**: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a
single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall
of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected.
To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice,
we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the
phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the
geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using
a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding
number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the
defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting
phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with
contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and
driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a
novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic
dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from
classical analogs.

**Abstract**: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for
future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network
optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook
crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on
offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless
dynamics and non-stationary environments. Furthermore, these models often lack
the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a
fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving
from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges
faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system
structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in
next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research
directions for realizing adaptive, robust, and autonomous wireless systems.

**PDF Url**: [2501.16071v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16071v2)

**Abstract**: High-energy nuclear collisions has recently emerged as a powerful
``imaging-by-smashing'' tool to reveal the global shapes of atomic nuclei.
Here, I layout a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how
nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution,
and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I
highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear
structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.


## Diffusion
### Navigating with Annealing Guidance Scale in Diffusion Space
**Authors**: Shai Yehezkel, Omer Dahary, Andrey Voynov, Daniel Cohen-Or

**PDF Url**: [2506.24108v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24108v1)

**Abstract**: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.


### Imagine for Me: Creative Conceptual Blending of Real Images and Text via Blended Attention
**Authors**: Wonwoong Cho, Yanxia Zhang, Yan-Ying Chen, David I. Inouye

**Published Date**: 2025-06-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-30

**PDF Url**: [2506.24085v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24085v1)

**Abstract**: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.


### Faster Diffusion Models via Higher-Order Approximation
**Authors**: Gen Li, Yuchen Zhou, Yuting Wei, Yuxin Chen

**Published Date**: 2025-06-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-30

**PDF Url**: [2506.24042v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24042v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.


### Pixel super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using diffusion models

**Abstract**: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free
microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically
stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution
virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both
the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining,
addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our
approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based
image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated
virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs.
Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free
human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual
staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution,
structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a
super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product
by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images.
Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves
resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual
staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential
for clinical diagnostics.


### Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jinhao Liang, Jacob K Christopher, Sven Koenig, Ferdinando Fioretto

**Published Date**: 2025-02-05

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-30

**PDF Url**: [2502.03607v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03607v2)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics,
enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw
representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion
models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in
enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic
feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot
Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces.
To address these challenges, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion
(SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion
sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible
trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark
to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot
densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results
show SMD consistently outperforms classical and other learning-based motion
planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot
environments.


## Quantitative Finance

**PDF Url**: [2506.23073v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23073v1)

**Abstract**: The extreme cases of risk measures, when considered within the context of
distributional ambiguity, provide significant guidance for practitioners
specializing in risk management of quantitative finance and insurance. In
contrast to the findings of preceding studies, we focus on the study of
extreme-case risk measure under distributional ambiguity with the property of
increasing failure rate (IFR). The extreme-case range Value-at-Risk under
distributional uncertainty, consisting of given mean and/or variance of
distributions with IFR, is provided. The specific characteristics of
extreme-case distributions under these constraints have been characterized, a
crucial step for numerical simulations. We then apply our main results to
stop-loss and limited loss random variables under distributional uncertainty
with IFR.


### SABR-Informed Multitask Gaussian Process: A Synthetic-to-Real Framework for Implied Volatility Surface Construction
**Authors**: Jirong Zhuang, Xuan Wu

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-28

**PDF Url**: [2506.22888v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22888v1)

**Abstract**: Constructing the Implied Volatility Surface (IVS) is a challenging task in
quantitative finance due to the complexity of real markets and the sparsity of
market data. Structural models like Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho (SABR) model
offer interpretability and theoretical consistency but lack flexibility, while
purely data-driven methods such as Gaussian Process regression can struggle
with sparse data. We introduce SABR-Informed Multi-Task Gaussian Process
(SABR-MTGP), treating IVS construction as a multi-task learning problem. Our
method uses a dense synthetic dataset from a calibrated SABR model as a source
task to inform the construction based on sparse market data (the target task).
The MTGP framework captures task correlation and transfers structural
information adaptively, improving predictions particularly in data-scarce
regions. Experiments using Heston-generated ground truth data under various
market conditions show that SABR-MTGP outperforms both standard Gaussian
process regression and SABR across different maturities. Furthermore, an
application to real SPX market data demonstrates the method's practical
applicability and its ability to produce stable and realistic surfaces. This
confirms our method balances structural guidance from SABR with the flexibility
needed for market data.
