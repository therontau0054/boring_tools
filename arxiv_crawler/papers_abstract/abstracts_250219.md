**Abstract**: Foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled datasets have
revolutionized natural language and computer vision, exhibiting remarkable
generalization capabilities, thus highlighting the importance of pre-training.
Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by
either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations
that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R,
an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations
learned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model.
Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from
videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth
estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric
structure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear
transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to
low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer
efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves
performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.

**Abstract**: We present Magma, a foundation model that serves multimodal AI agentic tasks
in both the digital and physical worlds. Magma is a significant extension of
vision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding
ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the
ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal
intelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot
manipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large
amounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics
data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in
images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object
movements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are
labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show
that SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of
spatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a
wide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new
state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks,
outperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On
image and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to
popular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets. We
make our model and code public for reproducibility at

**Abstract**: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to
understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase
transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients,
an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Making an analogy to
bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often
invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise
a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data.
By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically
recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of
dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus
provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without
governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. This approach can be
used as a standalone analysis tool, or as part of a broader data-driven
analysis framework.

**Abstract**: The compressible Euler-Riesz equations are fundamental with wide applications
in astrophysics, plasma physics, and mathematical biology. In this paper, we
are concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of
finite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with
large initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and
repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for
dimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit
of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the
Navier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing
viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It
is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no
concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we
prove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the
Euler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric
perturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the
potential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the
nonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which
is a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\"onwall type estimate
is required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in
the sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential.
Furthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions
for the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing
concentration compactness arguments. Steady states properties are obtained by
variational arguments connecting to recent advances in aggregation-diffusion
equations.

**Abstract**: Topological insulators (TIs) are quantum materials combining insulating bulk
properties with conductive surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry.
Their unique electromagnetic behavior originates from the topological
magnetoelectric effect encoded in an axion-like $\theta$-term ($\theta$ = $\pi$
mod 2$\pi$). This $\theta$-electrodynamics modifies Maxwell's equations
specifically at material interfaces through altered boundary conditions,
preserving conventional bulk electrodynamics while enabling surface-mediated
optical effects like polarization rotation and hybrid wave modes.
  This thesis explores electromagnetic wave confinement in TI-based waveguides.
Key advances include: (1) Controlled modification of reactive and dissipated
energies through polarization engineering in waveguide geometries; (2)
Experimental realization of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves violating
Earnshaw's theorem via $\theta$ discontinuities in coaxial TI structures,
demonstrating unique polarization rotation mechanisms and low-loss propagation
through bent fibers; (3) TEM wave confinement with fewer than two conductors
using imaginary $\theta$ parameters, explained through self-consistent surface
charge dynamics; (4) First-principles identification of hybrid TE-TM modes in
TI slab waveguides, contrasting with conventional magnetoelectric material
responses. These findings establish how surface boundary condition
modifications from $\theta$ enable new electromagnetic solutions despite
unchanged bulk equations.
  The demonstrated phenomena -- including modified propagation modes,
non-trivial polarization dynamics, and unconventional confinement -- suggest
photonic applications in polarization control and optical routing. By
connecting topological electrodynamics with waveguide physics, this work
provides both fundamental insights and practical design principles for
topological photonic systems.

**Abstract**: Buffer gas cooling, one of the most relevant direct cooling techniques for
cooling molecules, relies on dissipating the energy of the molecule via
collisions with a buffer gas. The cooling efficiency hinges on the
molecule-atom scattering properties, concretely, on the transport properties.
This work presents a global study on the interactions, collision dynamics, and
transport properties of monofluoride molecules (X-F), being X a metal, in the
presence of a cold He buffer gas. The interactions are calculated using ab
initio quantum chemistry methods, and the dynamics is treated fully quantal,
assuming the monofluoride molecule is a rigid rotor. The resulting
thermalization and rotational quenching rates are analyzed in light of the Born
Distorted Wave Approximation (BDWA), yielding an explanation based on the
elemental physical properties of the molecule under consideration. Therefore,
the analysis of our results reveals the physics behind the rotational quenching
of molecules in the presence of a cold buffer gas.


### An axion-like mechanism for confinement in QCD

**PDF Url**: [2211.01047v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01047v4)

**Abstract**: This letter is about confinement in QCD. At the moment we have pictures of
confinement to complete our understanding of the physics of strongly
interacting particles, interaction which asks for confinement. As it is said in
[1] : " In principle it should be possible to derive the confinement hypothesis
from the QCD Lagrangian. At this time, no rigorous derivation exists, so it is
not absolutely clear that the confinement hypothesis is a bone fide prediction
of QCD". In this letter we show that a sufficient (of course not necessary)
condition for confinement is that topological structure of vacuum in Nature
does not correspond to the $\theta$-vacuum. Therefore, if different vacua with
nontrivial winding number cannot be connected by tunneling, we obtain
confinement as a consequence. Moreover, we show that an axion-like mechanism
would suffice to describe a confined QCD phase.

**PDF Url**: [2502.13021v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13021v1)

**Abstract**: These lectures introduce the notion of asymptotic observables, which are
classes of measurable quantities predicted by quantum field theory. In gapped
theories with trivial infrared dynamics, these include scattering amplitudes,
expectation values of operators approaching infinity, inclusive cross sections,
etc. We argue for a unified picture in which various asymptotic observables are
related by analytic continuation embodying new versions of crossing symmetry.
As an application, we discuss the exponentiation of infrared divergences for
inclusive observables in Quantum Electrodynamics using time-folded contours.
Finally, we outline prospects for a systematic study of analyticity properties
of asymptotic observables using the Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform. These
notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon
workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.


### Search for medium effects using jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets from PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV
**Authors**: CMS Collaboration

**Published Date**: 2025-02-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-18

**PDF Url**: [2502.13020v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13020v1)

**Abstract**: The jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets is studied using lead-lead
(PbPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The
jet axis decorrelation is defined as the angular difference between two
definitions of the jet axis. It is obtained by applying two recombination
schemes on all the constituents of a given jet reconstructed by the anti-\kt
sequential algorithm with a distance parameter of $R$ = 0.4. The data set,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.66 nb$^{-1}$, was collected in
2018 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The jet axis decorrelations are
examined across collision centrality selections and intervals of jet transverse
momentum. A centrality dependent evolution of the measured distributions is
observed, with a progressive narrowing seen in more central events. This
narrowing could result from medium-induced modification of the internal jet
structure or reflect color charge effects in energy loss. This new measurement
probes jet substructure in previously unexplored kinematic domains and show
great promise for providing new insights on the color charge dependence of
energy loss to jet-quenching models.


### Inverse Seesaw Mechanism and Axion Portal Fermionic Dark Matter

**PDF Url**: [2502.13002v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13002v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) that addresses both
the smallness of neutrino masses and the dark matter (DM) puzzle via the
inverse seesaw mechanism and an axion portal fermionic DM. This model generates
light neutrino masses without requiring high energy scales, enhancing its
testability in future collider experiments. An axion-like particle (ALP)
connects the SM and DM sectors, yielding a distinct phenomenology and a
positive contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)$ anomaly.
Our analysis shows that the model is consistent with constraints from neutrino
oscillations, DM relic density, and indirect detection, as well as providing a
solution to the $g-2$ anomaly. The TeV-scale scalar sector and ALP interactions
suggest potential signals in collider experiments and astrophysical
observations. This work offers a unified framework to address neutrino masses
and DM, with implications for particle physics and cosmology.

**PDF Url**: [2502.09992v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09992v2)

**Abstract**: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large
language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a
diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data
masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer
to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a
principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive
benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our
self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong
LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive
instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue.
Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal
poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and
promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM
capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs. Project page and

### Does Training with Synthetic Data Truly Protect Privacy?
**Authors**: Yunpeng Zhao, Jie Zhang

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-18

**PDF Url**: [2502.12976v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12976v1)

**Abstract**: As synthetic data becomes increasingly popular in machine learning tasks,
numerous methods--without formal differential privacy guarantees--use synthetic
data for training. These methods often claim, either explicitly or implicitly,
to protect the privacy of the original training data. In this work, we explore
four different training paradigms: coreset selection, dataset distillation,
data-free knowledge distillation, and synthetic data generated from diffusion
models. While all these methods utilize synthetic data for training, they lead
to vastly different conclusions regarding privacy preservation. We caution that
empirical approaches to preserving data privacy require careful and rigorous
evaluation; otherwise, they risk providing a false sense of privacy.


### Guaranteed Conditional Diffusion: 3D Block-based Models for Scientific Data Compression
**Authors**: Jaemoon Lee, Xiao Li, Liangji Zhu, Sanjay Ranka, Anand Rangarajan

**Published Date**: 2025-02-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-18

**PDF Url**: [2502.12951v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12951v1)

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a new compression paradigm -- Guaranteed Conditional
Diffusion with Tensor Correction (GCDTC) -- for lossy scientific data
compression. The framework is based on recent conditional diffusion (CD)
generative models, and it consists of a conditional diffusion model, tensor
correction, and error guarantee. Our diffusion model is a mixture of 3D
conditioning and 2D denoising U-Net. The approach leverages a 3D block-based
compressing module to address spatiotemporal correlations in structured
scientific data. Then, the reverse diffusion process for 2D spatial data is
conditioned on the ``slices'' of content latent variables produced by the
compressing module. After training, the denoising decoder reconstructs the data
with zero noise and content latent variables, and thus it is entirely
deterministic. The reconstructed outputs of the CD model are further
post-processed by our tensor correction and error guarantee steps to control
and ensure a maximum error distortion, which is an inevitable requirement in
lossy scientific data compression. Our experiments involving two datasets
generated by climate and chemical combustion simulations show that our
framework outperforms standard convolutional autoencoders and yields
competitive compression quality with an existing scientific data compression
algorithm.


### Don't drop your samples! Coherence-aware training benefits Conditional diffusion
**Authors**: Nicolas Dufour, Victor Besnier, Vicky Kalogeiton, David Picard

**Published Date**: 2024-05-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-18

**PDF Url**: [2405.20324v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20324v2)

**Abstract**: Conditional diffusion models are powerful generative models that can leverage
various types of conditional information, such as class labels, segmentation
masks, or text captions. However, in many real-world scenarios, conditional
information may be noisy or unreliable due to human annotation errors or weak
alignment. In this paper, we propose the Coherence-Aware Diffusion (CAD), a
novel method that integrates coherence in conditional information into
diffusion models, allowing them to learn from noisy annotations without
discarding data. We assume that each data point has an associated coherence
score that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then
condition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the
coherence score. In this way, the model learns to ignore or discount the
conditioning when the coherence is low. We show that CAD is theoretically sound
and empirically effective on various conditional generation tasks. Moreover, we
show that leveraging coherence generates realistic and diverse samples that
respect conditional information better than models trained on cleaned datasets
where samples with low coherence have been discarded.


### RAPID: Retrieval Augmented Training of Differentially Private Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tanqiu Jiang, Changjiang Li, Fenglong Ma, Ting Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-02-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-18

**PDF Url**: [2502.12794v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12794v1)

**Abstract**: Differentially private diffusion models (DPDMs) harness the remarkable
generative capabilities of diffusion models while enforcing differential
privacy (DP) for sensitive data. However, existing DPDM training approaches
often suffer from significant utility loss, large memory footprint, and
expensive inference cost, impeding their practical uses. To overcome such
limitations, we present RAPID: Retrieval Augmented PrIvate Diffusion model, a
novel approach that integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into DPDM
training. Specifically, RAPID leverages available public data to build a
knowledge base of sample trajectories; when training the diffusion model on
private data, RAPID computes the early sampling steps as queries, retrieves
similar trajectories from the knowledge base as surrogates, and focuses on
training the later sampling steps in a differentially private manner. Extensive
evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that, with the same
privacy guarantee, RAPID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
by large margins in generative quality, memory footprint, and inference cost,
suggesting that retrieval-augmented DP training represents a promising
direction for developing future privacy-preserving generative models. The code
