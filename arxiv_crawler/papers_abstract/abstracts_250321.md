**Abstract**: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can
simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from
cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI
project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$
is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$<-1$ to a
present-day value~$>-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension,
describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to
that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically
natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter
consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark
energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark
matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits
a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in
a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall
growth of density perturbations.

**Abstract**: Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving
complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent
embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and
efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept
of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the
challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various
interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless
interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and
specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection
framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark
for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory
benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed
its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore
the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning,
aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.

**Abstract**: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led
to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data
analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve
differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is
not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural
Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve
Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained
to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe
moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular
fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in
different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are
unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard
numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in
critical situations.

**Abstract**: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry
and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of
the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is
frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to
construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current
research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and
solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural
networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when
applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of
ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger
training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable
model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce
a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction
Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the
predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting
differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing
models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies
than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates
self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a
reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF
calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new
benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger
molecular systems.

**Abstract**: Studies of iCVD kinetics often make assumptions about the iCVD vapor phase
that have been challenging to validate experimentally. We address this gap by
investigating heat transfer and mixing in the iCVD reactor using in-situ gas
composition sensing. Our work allows practitioners of iCVD to estimate the
degree of mixing and temperature profile in the vapor phase based on reactor
dimensions and process variables such as chamber pressure. We begin by using
dimensional analysis to simplify the parameter space governing heat transfer
and mixing, identifying key dimensionless groups that capture the dominant
physics. We find that the degree of mixing in the reactor is primarily
determined by the Peclet number (Pe), and heat transfer is primarily determined
by the Knudsen number (Kn). Multiphysics simulations of the iCVD reactor
provide visualizations of non-ideal mixing and allow us to identify the
critical Pe above which the well-mixed assumption may begin to break down. To
verify that the well-mixed assumption applies to iCVD at low Pe, we measured
the residence time distribution (RTD) for argon and isopropanol flowing at 1
sccm, finding a close match to the well-mixed model. We used a Pirani pressure
gauge for composition sensing to measure the RTD. We demonstrate the Pirani
gauge to be a precise gas composition sensor, which is more modular and less
expensive than methods like in-situ infrared spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry. We then address heat transfer by measuring thermal diffusion from
the filament at a range of pressures in argon and isopropanol. We quantified
the effects of non-ideal heat transfer at low pressures and identified a
critical Kn, above which heat transfer is independent of pressure. Measurement
of thermally driven pressure changes in batch mode enables us to define and
model an "effective temperature" for the reactor, matching the thermal
diffusion model.


### Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space
**Authors**: Raphael Chetrite, Stefano Marcantoni

**Published Date**: 2025-03-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-20

**PDF Url**: [2503.16369v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16369v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued
observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These
relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional
and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but
are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations.
In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as
isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover
we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies,
namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non
degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions
for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or
asymptotically large times.


### Neural Networks: According to the Principles of Grassmann Algebra
**Authors**: Z. Zarezadeh, N. Zarezadeh

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-20

**PDF Url**: [2503.16364v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16364v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we explore the algebra of quantum idempotents and the
quantization of fermions which gives rise to a Hilbert space equal to the
Grassmann algebra associated with the Lie algebra. Since idempotents carry
representations of the algebra under consideration, they form algebraic
varieties and smooth manifolds in the natural topology. In addition to the
motivation of linking up mathematical physics with machine learning, it is also
shown that by using idempotents and invariant subspace of the corresponding
algebras, these representations encode and perhaps provide a probabilistic
interpretation of reasoning and relational paths in geometrical terms.


### On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing
**Authors**: Alain M. Dikandé

**Published Date**: 2025-03-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-20

**PDF Url**: [2503.01196v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01196v2)

**Abstract**: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring
with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear
damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental
in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with
parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two
metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include
nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis
circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated
conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work
we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented
by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential
has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability
parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of
the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In
the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of
anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types.
However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical
solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described
by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into
consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases
or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply
varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model
carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the
standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the
bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.

**PDF Url**: [2503.16329v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16329v1)

**Abstract**: We investigate non-equilibrium electron dynamics in crystalline ZnO induced
by ultrashort, relatively intense, infrared laser pulses. Our focus is on
understanding the mechanism that facilitates efficient conduction band
population in ZnO to enable optically pumped lasing. We consider two different
pulse frequencies (in the near-infrared and mid-infrared) for which
experimental data are available, and we calculate the electronic response of a
ZnO crystal for a wide range of pulse intensities. We apply and compare three
complementary theoretical approaches: the analytical Keldysh model, the
numerical solution of the semiconductor Bloch equations, and real-time
time-dependent density functional theory. We conclude that time-dependent
density functional theory is a valid \textit{ab initio} approach for predicting
conduction band population, that offers an accurate enough description of
static and transient optical properties of solids and provides physics insight
into the intermediate excitation regime, where electronic excitations are
determined by the interplay of intraband tunneling, a consequence of band
bending, and interband multi-photon absorption.

**Abstract**: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling
to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their
structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since
classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented
level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions
of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies
for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands
or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect
requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical
circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be
needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale
systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of
scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot
array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to
each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture
provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D
square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices
can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on
the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while
maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme,
where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS
circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our
trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor
technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for
future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.

**Authors**: Liming Jiang, Qing Yan, Yumin Jia, Zichuan Liu, Hao Kang, Xin Lu

**Published Date**: 2025-03-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-20

**PDF Url**: [2503.16418v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16418v1)

**Abstract**: Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation
remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)
like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust
frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of
existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image
alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is
InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model
via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining
generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining
and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample
(SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality,
and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In
addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various
existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.


### DreamTexture: Shape from Virtual Texture with Analysis by Augmentation
**Authors**: Ananta R. Bhattarai, Xingzhe He, Alla Sheffer, Helge Rhodin

**PDF Url**: [2503.16412v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16412v1)

**Abstract**: DreamFusion established a new paradigm for unsupervised 3D reconstruction
from virtual views by combining advances in generative models and
differentiable rendering. However, the underlying multi-view rendering, along
with supervision from large-scale generative models, is computationally
expensive and under-constrained. We propose DreamTexture, a novel
Shape-from-Virtual-Texture approach that leverages monocular depth cues to
reconstruct 3D objects. Our method textures an input image by aligning a
virtual texture with the real depth cues in the input, exploiting the inherent
understanding of monocular geometry encoded in modern diffusion models. We then
reconstruct depth from the virtual texture deformation with a new conformal map
optimization, which alleviates memory-intensive volumetric representations. Our
experiments reveal that generative models possess an understanding of monocular
shape cues, which can be extracted by augmenting and aligning texture cues -- a
novel monocular reconstruction paradigm that we call Analysis by Augmentation.


### ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos

**Abstract**: Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality
videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts
during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources,
and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less
attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation
attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that
can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that
guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise
candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the
current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing
the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term
value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible
adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step
denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant
long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a
plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial
noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency
and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert
initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value,
leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover,
to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution
that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly
reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally
consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video
generation.


### Do Visual Imaginations Improve Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents?
**Authors**: Akhil Perincherry, Jacob Krantz, Stefan Lee

**Published Date**: 2025-03-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-20

**PDF Url**: [2503.16394v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16394v1)

**Abstract**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating an
unseen environment using natural language instructions. In this work, we study
if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as
navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize
these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image
diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions.
These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as
landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating
these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an
increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success
scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that
the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on
language instructions alone. Code and data for our work can be found at

**Abstract**: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of
so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion
Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in
generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed
generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating
diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in
previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic
framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables
flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable
quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with
our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a
lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical
Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of
the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder
drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply
FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic
evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D
generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for
generation. Code and models are available at

**Abstract**: Language models (LMs) have exhibited exceptional versatility in reasoning and
in-depth financial analysis through their proprietary information processing
capabilities. Previous research focused on evaluating classification
performance while often overlooking explainability or pre-conceived that
refined explanation corresponds to higher classification accuracy. Using a
public dataset in finance domain, we quantitatively evaluated self-explanations
by LMs, focusing on their factuality and causality. We identified the
statistically significant relationship between the accuracy of classifications
and the factuality or causality of self-explanations. Our study built an
empirical foundation for approximating classification confidence through
self-explanations and for optimizing classification via proprietary reasoning.
