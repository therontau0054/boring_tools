**Abstract**: It is quite common to use the generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) as
generic models to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles and to
gain a better understanding of the probabilistic or information theoretic
foundations of quantum physics and quantum computing. A variety of symmetry
postulates was introduced and studied in this framework, including the
transitivity of the automorphism group (1) on the pure states, (2) on the pairs
of orthogonal pure states [these pairs are called 2-frames] and (3) on any
frames of the same size. The second postulate is M\"uller and Ududec's bit
symmetry, which they motivate by quantum computational needs. Here we explore
these three postulates in the transition probability framework, which is more
specific than the GPTs since the existence of the transition probabilities for
the quantum logical atoms is presupposed either directly or indirectly via a
certain geometric property of the state space. This property for compact convex
sets was introduced by the author in a recent paper. We show that bit symmetry
implicates the symmetry of the transition probabilities between the atoms.
Using a result by Barnum and Hilgert, we can then conclude that the third
rather strong symmetry postulate rules out all models but the classical cases
and in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.

**Abstract**: Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced
robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for
simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g.,
the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when
handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce
DexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive
dexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through
a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact
alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive
generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics
model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated
guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical
interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues.
Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block
re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on
goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success
rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves
70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block
half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive,
highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.


### A tale of Bethe logarithms: leptonic widths of $Ï‡_{cJ}$ and Lamb shift
**Authors**: Yu Jia, Jichen Pan

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2411.18560v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18560v1)

**Abstract**: The rare annihilation decays of $P$-wave spin-triplet quarkonia into lepton
pair have to proceed via two-photon intermediate state, which are plagued with
the infrared divergence symptom. We recognize that the physical root of the IR
divergence and its remedy is the same as the Lamb shift in QED. In this work we
provide a complete solution to this IR problem by including the effect of the
higher Fock component of the $\chi_{cJ}$ state, {\it viz.}, the
$c\bar{c}(^3S_1^{(1)})$ pair accompanied with a very long wavelength photon.
Adding the contributions from the leading and next-to-leading order Fock
components together, we arrive at the IR finite and factorization scale
independent predictions for leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$. The Bethe
logarithms associated with these exclusive reactions are found to have rather
different traits from those associated with Lamb shift. We present numerical
predictions by employing several influential quark potential models. The
predicted leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$ are sizable and the observation
prospect for $e^+e^-\to \chi_{cJ}(1P,2P)$ at BESIII looks bright. The future
observation of $e^+e^-\to X(3872)$ will shed important light on the $c\bar{c}$
content of the $X(3872)$ meson.


### Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings
**Authors**: Shuangyuan Lu, Penghao Zhu, Yuan-Ming Lu

**Published Date**: 2024-11-11

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2411.07174v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07174v2)

**Abstract**: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for
a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence
with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer
wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T.
Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be
realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and
its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in
non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We
study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1)
strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed
states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer
pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a
pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the
bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and
mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as
pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study
examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their
critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.


### Shape Switching and Tunable Oscillations of Adaptive Droplets
**Authors**: Tim Dullweber, Roman Belousov, Camilla Autorino, Nicoletta Petridou, Anna Erzberger

**Published Date**: 2024-02-13

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2402.08664v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08664v3)

**Abstract**: Living materials adapt their shape to signals from the environment, yet the
impact of shape changes on signal processing and associated feedback dynamics
remain unclear. We find that droplets with signal-responsive interfacial
tensions exhibit shape bistability, excitable dynamics, and oscillations. The
underlying critical points reveal novel mechanisms for physical signal
processing through shape adaptation in soft active materials. We recover
signatures of one such critical point in experimental data from zebrafish
embryos, where it supports boundary formation.


### Complexity of Quantum-Mechanical Evolutions from Probability Amplitudes
**Authors**: Carlo Cafaro, Leonardo Rossetti, Paul M. Alsing

**Published Date**: 2024-08-26

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2408.14241v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14241v2)

**Abstract**: We study the complexity of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum
Hamiltonian evolutions connecting arbitrary source and a target states on the
Bloch sphere equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. This investigation is
performed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\"odinger
quantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the
speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical
trajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from
a classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric
complexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on
curved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only
partial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic
quantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the
complexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity
length scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both
quantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e.,
total) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the
quantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Third, after
calculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one
of the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with
that of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the
curvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions
are less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that
complexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent
can exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a
smaller curvature coefficient.


### The Solvay Councils, de Broglie's brothers, and the development of wave-particle duality
**Authors**: Alessio Rocci, Franklin J. Lambert

**Published Date**: 2024-11-27

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2411.18524v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18524v1)

**Abstract**: The meeting patronized by Ernest Solvay in 1911, the first Solvay Council,
marked the beginning of what can be called the first quantum revolution.
Maurice de Broglie was one of the secretaries of the Council. He participated
in the two following conferences and contributed to the third Council with his
work. Louis de Broglie collaborated and discussed with his elder brother.
Departing from Maurice's achievements, Louis developed his approach to the
wave-particle duality of light and extended it to other particles. He presented
it at the fifth meeting in 1927. This paper investigates the connection between
the two scientists and the Solvay Councils, arguing that this link was
essential in developing the first quantum revolution, a process that ended,
according to Werner Heisenberg, at the fifth Solvay Physics Council.


### Scaling SU(2) to 1000 GPUs using HiRep
**Authors**: Sofie Martins, Erik Kjellgren, Emiliano Molinaro, Claudio Pica, Antonio Rago

**Published Date**: 2024-11-27

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2411.18511v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18511v1)

**Abstract**: HiRep allows flexible simulations of higher representations of Wilson
Fermions with various actions and gauge groups and a range of inverters and
integrators. This is particularly important for enabling evaluations of
observables relevant to phenomenological inputs for Beyond-the-Standard-Model
physics from lattice field theory. We present progress on the GPU porting of
available features, especially in terms of scaling to large jobs on AMD GPUs.


### Quantifying the Chirality of Vibrational Modes in Helical Molecular Chains
**Authors**: Ethan Abraham, Abraham Nitzan

**Published Date**: 2023-10-25

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2310.16352v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16352v5)

**Abstract**: The lack of quantitative methods for studying chirality has stunted our
theoretical understanding of chirality-induced physical phenomena. The chiral
phonon has been proposed to be involved in various physical phenomena, but it
is not yet well defined mathematically. Here we examine two approaches for
assigning and quantifying the chirality of molecular normal modes in
double-helical molecular wires with various levels of twist. First, associating
with each normal mode a structure obtained by imposing the corresponding motion
on a common atomic origin, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to
quantitatively assess the relationship between the chirality-weighted normal
mode spectrum and the chirality of the underlying molecular structure. We find
that increasing the amount of twist in the double helix shifts the mean normal
mode CCM to drastically higher values, implying that the chirality of molecular
normal modes is strongly correlated with that of the underlying molecular
structure. Second, we assign to each normal mode a pseudoscaler defined as the
product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms, and we
analyze the handedness of the normal mode spectrum with respect to this
quantity. We find that twisting the double-chain structure introduces asymmetry
between right and left-handed normal modes so that in twisted structures
different frequency bands are characterized by distinct handedness. This may
give rise to global phenomena such as thermal chirality.


### Unveiling the optimization process of Physics Informed Neural Networks: How accurate and competitive can PINNs be?
**Authors**: Jorge F. UrbÃ¡n, Petros Stefanou, JosÃ© A. Pons

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2405.04230v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04230v2)

**Abstract**: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed
neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and
traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization
algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple
modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an
additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a
greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical
considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation.
On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally
adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several
orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results
obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30
neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing
thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of
PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across
various fields.


## Diffusion
### Diffusion Self-Distillation for Zero-Shot Customized Image Generation
**Authors**: Shengqu Cai, Eric Chan, Yunzhi Zhang, Leonidas Guibas, Jiajun Wu, Gordon Wetzstein

**Published Date**: 2024-11-27

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2411.18616v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18616v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models produce impressive results but are frustrating
tools for artists who desire fine-grained control. For example, a common use
case is to create images of a specific instance in novel contexts, i.e.,
"identity-preserving generation". This setting, along with many other tasks
(e.g., relighting), is a natural fit for image+text-conditional generative
models. However, there is insufficient high-quality paired data to train such a
model directly. We propose Diffusion Self-Distillation, a method for using a
pre-trained text-to-image model to generate its own dataset for
text-conditioned image-to-image tasks. We first leverage a text-to-image
diffusion model's in-context generation ability to create grids of images and
curate a large paired dataset with the help of a Visual-Language Model. We then
fine-tune the text-to-image model into a text+image-to-image model using the
curated paired dataset. We demonstrate that Diffusion Self-Distillation
outperforms existing zero-shot methods and is competitive with per-instance
tuning techniques on a wide range of identity-preservation generation tasks,
without requiring test-time optimization.


### Synthetic ECG Generation for Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning in Arrhythmia Classification
**Authors**: JosÃ© Fernando NÃºÃ±ez, Jamie Arjona, Javier BÃ©jar

**Published Date**: 2024-11-27

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2411.18456v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18456v1)

**Abstract**: Deep learning models need a sufficient amount of data in order to be able to
find the hidden patterns in it. It is the purpose of generative modeling to
learn the data distribution, thus allowing us to sample more data and augment
the original dataset. In the context of physiological data, and more
specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, given its sensitive nature and
expensive data collection, we can exploit the benefits of generative models in
order to enlarge existing datasets and improve downstream tasks, in our case,
classification of heart rhythm.
  In this work, we explore the usefulness of synthetic data generated with
different generative models from Deep Learning namely Diffweave, Time-Diffusion
and Time-VQVAE in order to obtain better classification results for two open
source multivariate ECG datasets. Moreover, we also investigate the effects of
transfer learning, by fine-tuning a synthetically pre-trained model and then
progressively adding increasing proportions of real data. We conclude that
although the synthetic samples resemble the real ones, the classification
improvement when simply augmenting the real dataset is barely noticeable on
individual datasets, but when both datasets are merged the results show an
increase across all metrics for the classifiers when using synthetic samples as
augmented data. From the fine-tuning results the Time-VQVAE generative model
has shown to be superior to the others but not powerful enough to achieve
results close to a classifier trained with real data only. In addition, methods
and metrics for measuring closeness between synthetic data and the real one
have been explored as a side effect of the main research questions of this
study.


### Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis
**Authors**: Naoki Saito, Stefan C. Schonsheck, Eugene Shvarts

**Published Date**: 2023-11-17

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-27

**PDF Url**: [2311.10270v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10270v5)

**Abstract**: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial
complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs).
Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial
complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently
developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given
simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh
Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The
$\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e.,
dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion
coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to
a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of
the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering
of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs).
Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a
natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may
be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder
to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and
geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are
able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used
along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or
support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with
far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally,
we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems:
signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and
molecular dynamics prediction.


### G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation

**Abstract**: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown
promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level
dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic
understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time
semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by
leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative
models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature
extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This
integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while
eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into
diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both
terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive
experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average
success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object
generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for
robotic manipulation policies.
