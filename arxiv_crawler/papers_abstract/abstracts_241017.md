**Abstract**: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of
$2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a
system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary
gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down
in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries
can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts
the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this
paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in
general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with
unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries
lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the
connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie
algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically
deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the
framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive
symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two
different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of
the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical
observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore
the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its
absence.

**Abstract**: A fundamental challenge in modern physics is bridging the gap between an
exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description
of many-body macroscopic systems. This gap may be bridged by tracing the
properties of well-controlled intermediate-size mesoscopic systems. Here, we
study mesoscopic signatures of a spatial self-organization phase transition in
deterministically prepared arrays of between 10 and 22 atoms inside an optical
cavity. Through precise engineering of the atom-cavity interactions, we reveal
how critical behavior depends on atom number. We identify characteristic
dynamical behaviors related to symmetry breaking and system size in the
self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at
the critical point. This work opens the door to probing particle-number- and
time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.


### A transformational approach to collective behavior

**Abstract**: This paper presents a revolutionary approach to the characterization,
forecast, and control of collective systems. Collective systems are an ensemble
of conservatively interacting entities. The evolution of the entities are
determined by symmetries of the entities. Collective systems take many
different forms. A plasma is a collective of charged particles, a fluid is a
collective of molecules, a elementary field is a collective of elementary
particles, and a cosmos is a collective of celestial bodies. Our new theory
builds on the canonical transformation approach to dynamics. This approach
recognizes that the symmetry leads to the conservation of a real function, that
is the infinitesimal generator of a Lie group. The finite generator of the
canonical transformation is derived from the infinitesimal generator by the
solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This generating function is also
known as the action, the entropy, and the logarithmic likelihood. The new
theory generalizes this generating function to the generating functional of the
collective field. Finally, this paper derives the formula for the Mayer Cluster
Expansion, or the S-matrix expansion of the generating functional. We call it
the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). Practically, this is a
localized Fourier Transformation, whose principal components give the
singularity spectrums, that is the solution to the Renormalization Group
Equations. Limitations on the measurement of the system (that is the Born Rule
and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) lead to quantization of the
stochastic probabilities of the collective field. How different collective
systems couple together to form systems-of-systems is formalized. The details
of a practical implementation of the HST will be presented.

**Abstract**: The real world obeys quantum physics and quantum computing presents an
alternative way to map physical problems to systems that follow the same laws.
Such computation fundamentally constitutes a better way to understand the most
challenging quantum problems. One such problem is the accurate simulation of
highly correlated quantum systems. Due to the high dimensionality of the
problem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately
predict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are
present. Still, modern day quantum hardware has many limitations and only
allows for modeling of very simple systems. Here we present for the first time
a quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is
an important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes
such as oxygen transport and immune defence, and is also used as a key
component in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To better characterise the
mechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) based on fermionic excitations and quantum embedding methods
is used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve Anderson impurity
model (AIM). Finally, it is concluded that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin
is largely influenced by the many-body correction and that the computational
effort for solving correlated electron systems could be substantially reduced
with the introduction of quantum computing algorithms. We encourage the use of
the Hamiltonian systems presented in this paper as a benchmark for testing
quantum computing algorithms efficiency for chemistry applications.

**Abstract**: A muon-flux measurement behind the beam dump of the J-PARC Hadron
Experimental Facility was performed with a compact muon detector that can be
inserted into a vertical observing hole with 81 mm in diameter which was dug
underground. The detector consists of 12 plastic scintillation strips with a
length of 80 mm each, which are arranged with cylindrical shape and contained
inside an aluminum housing with an outer diameter of 75 mm. A silicon
photomultiplier is coupled to the end of each strip to collect the
scintillating light. The flux of the muons penetrating the beam dump was
scanned vertically at intervals of 0.5 m, showing a wide distribution with a
maximum at the beam level. The muon flux was consistent with the expectation
from a Monte-Carlo simulation at more than 1 m away from the beam axis, which
is expected to be used for signal-loss evaluation in the future KOTO II
experiment for measuring rare kaon decays. The data can also be used in
improving the accuracy of shielding calculations in the radiation protection.

**Abstract**: The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) is a conformally invariant random
collection of loops. In the non-simple regime $\kappa'\in (4,8)$, it describes
the scaling limit of the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolations. CLE
percolations were introduced by Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2017). The
CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations describe the scaling limit of a natural variant of
the FK percolation called the fuzzy Potts model, which has an additional
percolation parameter $r$. Based on CLE percolations and assuming that the
convergence of the FK percolation to CLE, K{\"o}hler-Schindler and Lehmkuehler
(2022) derived all the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model except the bulk
one-arm exponent. In this paper, we exactly solve this exponent, which
prescribes the dimension of the clusters in CLE$_{\kappa'}$ percolations. As a
special case, the bichromatic one-arm exponent for the critical 3-state Potts
model should be $4/135$. To the best of our knowledge, this natural exponent
was not predicted in physics. Our derivation relies on the iterative
construction of CLE percolations from the boundary conformal loop ensemble
(BCLE), and the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and SLE curves. The
source of the exact solvability comes from the structure constants of boundary
Liouville conformal field theory. A key technical step is to prove a conformal
welding result for the target-invariant radial SLE curves. As intermediate
steps in our derivation, we obtain several exact results for BCLE in both the
simple and non-simple regimes, which extend results of Ang-Sun-Yu-Zhuang (2024)
on the touching probability of non-simple CLE. This also provides an
alternative derivation of the relation between the BCLE parameter $\rho$ and
the additional percolation parameter $r$ in CLE percolations, which was
originally due to Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2021, 2022).


### Extreme time extrapolation capabilities and thermodynamic consistency of physics-inspired Neural Networks for the 3D microstructure evolution of materials via Cahn-Hilliard flow

**PDF Url**: [2407.20126v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20126v2)

**Abstract**: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the
evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as
described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired
architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted
evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration
schemes. The method can accurately reproduce the evolution of microstructures
not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs.
Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the
theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, consisting of a
layered, phase-separated morphology, despite the training set containing only
relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with
the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to the late
coarsening stages, proving that this class of Machine Learning approaches can
become a new and powerful tool for the long timescale and high throughput
simulation of materials, while retaining thermodynamic consistency and
high-accuracy.


### Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks
**Authors**: Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin

**PDF Url**: [2410.12710v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12710v1)

**Abstract**: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and
process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs.
Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore
crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via
discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect
on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin
disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is
seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that
maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are
impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state.
Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for
phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and
distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin
disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder,
irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE
can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths
at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle
entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are
crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in
a lab setting.

**Abstract**: Sustainable advancement is being made to improve the efficiency of the
generation, transmission, and distribution of renewable energy resources, as
well as managing them to ensure the reliable operation of the smart grid.
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) enables sustainable management
of grid communication flow through its real-time data sensing, processing, and
actuation capabilities at various levels in the energy distribution framework.
The security vulnerabilities associated with the SCADA-enabled grid
infrastructure and management could jeopardize the smart grid operations. This
work explores the potential of Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUF) for
the security, privacy, and reliability of the smart grid's energy transmission
and distribution framework.
  Quantum computing has emerged as a formidable security solution for
high-performance computing applications through its probabilistic nature of
information processing. This work has a quantum hardware-assisted security
mechanism based on intrinsic properties of quantum hardware driven by quantum
mechanics to provide tamper-proof security for quantum computing driven smart
grid infrastructure. This work introduces a novel QPUF architecture using
quantum logic gates based on quantum decoherence, entanglement, and
superposition. This generates a unique bitstream for each quantum device as a
fingerprint. The proposed QPUF design is evaluated on IBM and Google quantum
systems and simulators. The deployment on the IBM quantum simulator
(ibmq_qasm_simulator) has achieved an average Hamming distance of 50.07%, 51%
randomness, and 86% of the keys showing 100% reliability.


### Area measures and branched polymers in supercritical Liouville quantum gravity
**Authors**: Manan Bhatia, Ewain Gwynne, Jinwoo Sung

**PDF Url**: [2410.12693v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12693v1)

**Abstract**: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a.
strongly coupled) phase, which has background charge $Q \in (0,2)$ and central
charge $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{L}} = 1+6Q^2 \in (1,25)$. Recent works have shown
how to define LQG in this phase as a planar random geometry associated with a
variant of the Gaussian free field, which exhibits "infinite spikes." In
contrast, a number of results from physics, dating back to the 1980s, suggest
that supercritical LQG surfaces should behave like "branched polymers": i.e.,
they should look like the continuum random tree. We prove a result which
reconciles these two descriptions of supercritical LQG. More precisely, we show
that for a family of random planar maps with boundary in the universality class
of supercritical LQG, if we condition on the (small probability) event that the
planar map is finite, then the scaling limit is the continuum random tree. We
also show that there does not exist any locally finite measure associated with
supercritical LQG which is locally determined by the field and satisfies the
LQG coordinate change formula. Our proofs are based on a branching process
description of supercritical LQG which comes from its coupling with CLE$_4$
(Ang and Gwynne, arXiv:2308.11832).


## Diffusion
### Meta-Unlearning on Diffusion Models: Preventing Relearning Unlearned Concepts
**Authors**: Hongcheng Gao, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Taihang Hu, Zhijie Deng, Min Lin

**Published Date**: 2024-10-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-16

**PDF Url**: [2410.12777v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12777v1)

**Abstract**: With the rapid progress of diffusion-based content generation, significant
efforts are being made to unlearn harmful or copyrighted concepts from
pretrained diffusion models (DMs) to prevent potential model misuse. However,
it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release,
malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the
unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g.,
"skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"),
facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose
meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an
unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes
malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts
retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning
of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most
existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an
easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical
experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4
and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sail-sg/Meta-Unlearning.


### SAFREE: Training-Free and Adaptive Guard for Safe Text-to-Image And Video Generation
**Authors**: Jaehong Yoon, Shoubin Yu, Vaidehi Patil, Huaxiu Yao, Mohit Bansal

**PDF Url**: [2410.12761v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12761v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced their ability
to generate high-quality images and videos, but they have also increased the
risk of producing unsafe content. Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for
safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several
challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training.
(2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3)
They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated
to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free
approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights.
Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in
the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace,
thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To
balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts,
SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings.
Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the
diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features
related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures
coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the
output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I
generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted
concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive
results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I
backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE
provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.


### Diffusion Language Models Are Versatile Protein Learners
**Authors**: Xinyou Wang, Zaixiang Zheng, Fei Ye, Dongyu Xue, Shujian Huang, Quanquan Gu

**Published Date**: 2024-02-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-16

**PDF Url**: [2402.18567v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18567v2)

**Abstract**: This paper introduces diffusion protein language model (DPLM), a versatile
protein language model that demonstrates strong generative and predictive
capabilities for protein sequences. We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from
evolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised
discrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling
for proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability
to generate structurally plausible, novel, and diverse protein sequences for
unconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion
generative pre-training makes DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins,
making it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for
various predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2 (Lin et al., 2022).
Moreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess
of conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide
sequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success
rate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioner, e.g.,
structure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence
generation towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary
structures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance. Code is released at

### Embedding an Ethical Mind: Aligning Text-to-Image Synthesis via Lightweight Value Optimization
**Authors**: Xingqi Wang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, Jia Jia

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-16

**PDF Url**: [2410.12700v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12700v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have
enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often
produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and
offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs),
the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely
unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value
Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human
values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a
specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of
generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a
diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically
approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more
flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the
value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a
text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image,
value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through
adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces
harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong
baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.


### Hamiltonian bridge: A physics-driven generative framework for targeted pattern control
**Authors**: Vishaal Krishnan, Sumit Sinha, L. Mahadevan

**Published Date**: 2024-10-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-16

**PDF Url**: [2410.12665v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12665v1)

**Abstract**: Patterns arise spontaneously in a range of systems spanning the sciences, and
their study typically focuses on mechanisms to understand their evolution in
space-time. Increasingly, there has been a transition towards controlling these
patterns in various functional settings, with implications for engineering.
Here, we combine our knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern
formation in non-equilibrium systems, and the power of stochastic optimal
control approaches to present a framework that allows us to control patterns at
multiple scales, which we dub the "Hamiltonian bridge". We use a mapping
between stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian
pattern forming PDEs to leverage our recent approach utilizing the
Feynman-Kac-based adjoint path integral formulation for the control of
interacting particles and generalize this to the active control of patterning
fields. We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via
numerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a
conserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled
reaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for
spatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments
in terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes
the geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns
and the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how
optimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative
control protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient
flows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in
physical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in
non-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales.
