**Abstract**: This work introduces a method for correcting the output distribution of a
quantum computer that does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more
physical qubits. Thus, it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum
error correction codes. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel
(we can bias the noise with twirling), the ideal output distribution and noisy
distribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove
that this matrix has a circulant block structure. Thus, the ideal distribution
can be retrieved from the noisy output distribution by applying the Fast
Fourier Transform. Moreover, due to its circulant structure, characterization
of this matrix can be achieved by sampling a single circuit. The results are
corroborated with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and
30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum
phase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits.
The correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output
distributions. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution
fidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.

**Abstract**: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a
unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary
structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent
progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are
interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these
concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero
pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for
the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework,
we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been
proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in
detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.


### Visualizing quantum entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates without state vectors
**Authors**: Russell B. Thompson

**PDF Url**: [2501.03199v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03199v1)

**Abstract**: Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical
temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude
more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of
Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of
spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between
boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without
the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a
thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map
classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through
the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena,
such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and
contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring
polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is
mentioned.

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-06

**PDF Url**: [2411.03494v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03494v2)

**Abstract**: This paper presents a Sim2Real (Simulation to Reality) approach to bridge the
gap between a trained agent in a simulated environment and its real-world
implementation in navigating a robot in a similar setting. Specifically, we
focus on navigating a quadruped robot in a real-world grid-like environment
inspired by the Gymnasium Frozen Lake -- a highly user-friendly and free
Application Programming Interface (API) to develop and test Reinforcement
Learning (RL) algorithms. We detail the development of a pipeline to transfer
motion policies learned in the Frozen Lake simulation to a physical quadruped
robot, thus enabling autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in a grid
without relying on expensive localization and mapping sensors. The work
involves training an RL agent in the Frozen Lake environment and utilizing the
resulting Q-table to control a 12 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) quadruped robot. In
addition to detailing the RL implementation, inverse kinematics-based quadruped
gaits, and the transfer policy pipeline, we open-source the project on GitHub
and include a demonstration video of our Sim2Real transfer approach. This work
provides an accessible, straightforward, and low-cost framework for
researchers, students, and hobbyists to explore and implement RL-based robot
navigation in real-world grid environments.

**Abstract**: Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in quantum critical
Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with
a dc electrical conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, and thermodynamic variables
such as the entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous
flow of charge is frequently reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the
value of $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, predicted to be quantized and determined only by
the universality class of the critical point, has not been established
experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality
in graphene transport by combining the electrical ($\sigma$) and thermal
($\kappa_\mathrm{e}$) conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the
Dirac point. We find that $\sigma$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{e}$ are inversely
related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$
converges to $\approx (4\pm 1)\times e^2/h$ for multiple devices, where $e$ and
$h$ are the electronic charge and the Planck's constant, respectively. We also
observe, (1) a giant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law where the effective
Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to
the Dirac point at low temperatures, and (2) the effective dynamic viscosity
($\eta_\mathrm{th}$) in the thermal regime approaches the holographic limit
$\eta_\mathrm{th}/s_\mathrm{th} \rightarrow \hbar/4\pi k_\mathrm{B}$ within a
factor of four in the cleanest devices close to the room temperature, where
$s_\mathrm{th}$ and $k_\mathrm{B}$ are the thermal entropy density and the
Boltzmann constant, respectively. Our experiment addresses the missing piece in
the potential of high-quality graphene as a testing bed for some of the
unifying concepts in physics.

**Abstract**: A major task in particle physics is the measurement of rare signal processes.
Even modest improvements in background rejection, at a fixed signal efficiency,
can significantly enhance the measurement sensitivity. Building on prior
research by others that incorporated physical symmetries into neural networks,
this work extends those ideas to include additional physics-motivated features.
Specifically, we introduce energy-dependent particle interaction strengths,
derived from leading-order SM predictions, into modern deep learning
architectures, including Transformer Architectures (Particle Transformer), and
Graph Neural Networks (Particle Net). These interaction strengths, represented
as the SM interaction matrix, are incorporated into the attention matrix
(transformers) and edges (graphs). Our results in event classification show
that the integration of all physics-motivated features improves background
rejection by $10\%-40\%$ over baseline models, with an additional gain of
approximately $10\%$ (absolute) due to the SM interaction matrix. This study
also provides one of the broadest comparisons of event classifiers to date,
demonstrating how various architectures perform across this task. A simplified
statistical analysis demonstrates that these enhanced architectures yield
significant improvements in signal significance compared to a graph network
baseline.


### Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions

**PDF Url**: [2501.03185v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03185v1)

**Abstract**: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for
populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines
weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of
synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency.
We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease)
the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based
on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes
and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the
quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes
in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous
transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that
the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves
the irreversible nature in the relative motion of the original model and thus
shows more accurate results than the analysis using the quasilinear response
relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the
conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual model
roughly preserves the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous
transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.

**Abstract**: Time-stretch electro-optic detection allows THz waveforms to be recorded in
single-shot, up to Megahertz acquisition rates. This capability is required in
accelerator physics, and also opens new applications in table-top THz
time-domain spectroscopy. However, the technique has also been notoriously
known for the need of high speed -- and high cost -- ADCs or oscilloscopes for
the readout. Furthermore, the resulting cost considerably increases with the
number of samples that is needed per THz waveform, an issue that has severely
limited the widespread of the technique so far. In this article, we show that
particularly cost-effective designs can be obtained by using 1550~nm probes. We
present the performances of an experimental design, that uses only standard
components (including dispersive devices), and a standard commercial probe
laser without additional pulse broadening. In these conditions, our
time-stretch system could already record coherent THz pulses at the SOLEIL
synchrotron radiation facility, over an unprecedented number of samples, using
oscilloscopes and ADC boards with only 1-3 GHz bandwidth.

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.14536v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14536v2)

**Abstract**: This work investigates the capability of future lepton colliders to determine
the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling through the vector boson fusion (VBF) $Zh$
process. This channel offers a model-independent way to probe the sign of the
gauge-Higgs coupling. Its sensitivity to interference effects and universal
coupling with new physics makes it particularly effective. We show that a
high-energy lepton collider such as CLIC can fully determine the sign of the
gauge-Higgs coupling in a model-independent way and with high confidence.


### Low-Rank Variational Quantum Algorithm for the Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems

**Abstract**: The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous
outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the
development of quantum technologies. Near-term quantum computers may bring
considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and
dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms
to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state
in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is
developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by
the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a
bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its
density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical
mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as
additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a
significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density
matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ans\"atze are
proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics
of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the
algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in
the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum
device.


## Diffusion
### Deep-Relative-Trust-Based Diffusion for Decentralized Deep Learning
**Authors**: Muyun Li, Aaron Fainman, Stefan Vlaski

**Published Date**: 2025-01-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-06

**PDF Url**: [2501.03162v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03162v1)

**Abstract**: Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn
efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or
orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an
averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue
that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often
over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as
opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the
development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion,
based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure
for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy,
and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse
topologies, in an image classification task.


### Large language models for artificial general intelligence (AGI): A survey of foundational principles and approaches
**Authors**: Alhassan Mumuni, Fuseini Mumuni

**Abstract**: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on large-scale
pretrained foundation models (PFMs) such as vision-language models, large
language models (LLMs), diffusion models and vision-language-action (VLA)
models have demonstrated the ability to solve complex and truly non-trivial AI
problems in a wide variety of domains and contexts. Multimodal large language
models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources,
allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing
extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful
dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex
problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this
impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on
large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic
LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of
foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory --
are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general
intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide
LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization
of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more
generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the
aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for
implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the
principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be
leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an
organic manner.

**Abstract**: Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque
deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the
decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also
reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could
advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant
concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study
proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual
Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery
leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In
the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a
counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a
disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to
identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of
CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed
not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers.
Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than
those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being
12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great
potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of
human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this
direction.
