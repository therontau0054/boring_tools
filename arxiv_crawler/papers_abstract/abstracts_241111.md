**Abstract**: We introduce a nonstabilizerness monotone which we name basis-minimised
stabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of $G$-asymmetry, a
measure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect
to a symmetry group $G$. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong
monotone for magic-state resource theory, while it can be extended to mixed
states via the convex roof construction. We discuss its relation with other
magic monotones, first showing that the BMSA coincides with the recently
introduced basis-minimized measurement entropy, thereby establishing the strong
monotonicity of the latter. Next, we provide inequalities between the BMSA and
other nonstabilizerness measures known in the literature. Finally, we present
numerical methods to compute the BMSA, highlighting its advantages and
drawbacks compared to other nonstabilizerness measures in the context of pure
many-body quantum states. We also discuss the importance of additivity and
strong monotonicity for measures of nonstabilizerness in many-body physics,
motivating the search for additional computable nonstabilizerness monotones.

**Abstract**: Combinatorial assembly uses standardized unit primitives to build objects
that satisfy user specifications. This paper studies assembly sequence planning
(ASP) for physical combinatorial assembly. Given the shape of the desired
object, the goal is to find a sequence of actions for placing unit primitives
to build the target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned
assembly sequence is physically executable. However, ASP for combinatorial
assembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To
address the challenge, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a
construction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the
desired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask
that filters out invalid actions, which effectively guides policy learning and
ensures violation-free deployment. In the end, we apply the proposed method to
Lego assembly with more than 250 3D structures. The experiment results
demonstrate that the proposed method plans physically valid assembly sequences
to build all structures, achieving a $100\%$ success rate, whereas the best
comparable baseline fails more than $40$ structures. Our implementation is

### Advantages of the adoption of a generalized flame displacement velocity as a central element of flamelet theory

**Abstract**: In combustion theory, flames are usually described in terms of the dynamics
of iso-surfaces of a specific scalar. The flame displacement speed is then
introduced as a local variable quantifying the progression of these
iso-surfaces relative to the flow field. While formally defined as a scalar,
the physical meaning of this quantity allows relating it with a vector pointing
along the normal direction of the scalar iso-surface. In this work, this
one-dimensional concept is extended by the introduction of a generalized flame
displacement velocity vector, which is associated with the dynamics of
iso-surfaces of two generic scalars, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. It is then shown how
a new flamelet paradigm can be built around this velocity vector, which leads
to a very compact and generic set of two-dimensional flamelet equations for
thermochemical quantities and the conditioning scalar gradients, $g_{\alpha} =
\lvert \nabla \alpha \rvert$ and $g_{\beta} = \lvert \nabla \beta \rvert$. The
most important features of the developed framework are discussed in the context
of partially-premixed flames, which provides significant insights into several
aspects of the theory, including the nature of the different contributions to
the flamelet equations for the conditioning scalar gradients and the fact that
different flamelet coordinate systems (orthogonal and non-orthogonal) can be
characterized by the same flame displacement velocity vector. This approach
opens an entire spectrum of possibilities for the definition of new
two-dimensional composition spaces, which represents a very promising basis for
the development of new variants of flamelet theory.

**Abstract**: I give a theoretical overview of magnetic monopoles, focusing on the physical
perspective of monopoles as hypothetical particles rather than as mathematical
objects. I argue that monopoles are exceptionally interesting hypothetical
particles and discuss the prospects of addressing the question of their
existence, and possibly producing them, in particle physics experiments.

**Abstract**: The particle-in-cell (PIC) method is a well-established and widely used
kinetic plasma modelling approach that provides a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian
approach to solve the plasma kinetic equation. Despite its power in capturing
details of the underlying physics of plasmas, conventional PIC implementations
are associated with a significant computational cost, rendering their
applications for real-world plasma science and engineering challenges
impractical. The acceleration of the PIC method has thus become a topic of high
interest, with several approaches having been pursued to this end. Among these,
the concept of reduced-order (RO) PIC simulations, first introduced in 2023,
provides a uniquely flexible and computationally efficient framework for
kinetic plasma modelling - characteristics verified extensively in various
plasma configurations. In this two-part article, we report the latest progress
achieved on RO-PIC. Part I article revisits the original RO-PIC formulation and
introduces refinements that substantially enhance the cost-efficiency and
accuracy of the method. We discuss these refinements in comparison against the
original formulation, illustrating the progression to a "first-order"
implementation from the baseline "zeroth-order" one. In a detailed step-by-step
verification, we first test the newly updated reduced-dimension Poisson solver
(RDPS) in the first-order RO-PIC against its zeroth-order counterpart using
test-case Poisson problems. Next, comparing against the zeroth-order version,
we examine the performance of the complete first-order RO-PIC code in
two-dimensional plasma problems. The detailed verifications demonstrate that
the improvements in the RO-PIC formulation enable the approach to provide
full-2D-equivalent results at a substantially lower (up to an order of
magnitude) computational cost compared to the zeroth-order RO-PIC.

**PDF Url**: [2411.05748v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05748v1)

**Abstract**: Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs), leveraging free-space light wave
propagation for ultra-parallel, high-efficiency computing, have emerged as
promising artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. However, their inherent
lack of reconfigurability due to fixed optical structures post-fabrication
hinders practical deployment in the face of dynamic AI workloads and evolving
applications. To overcome this challenge, we introduce, for the first time, a
multi-dimensional reconfigurable hybrid diffractive ONN system (MDR-HDONN), a
physically composable architecture that unlocks a new degree of freedom and
unprecedented versatility in DONNs. By leveraging full-system learnability,
MDR-HDONN repurposes fixed fabricated optical hardware, achieving exponentially
expanded functionality and superior task adaptability through the
differentiable learning of system variables. Furthermore, MDR-HDONN adopts a
hybrid optical/photonic design, combining the reconfigurability of integrated
photonics with the ultra-parallelism of free-space diffractive systems.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MDR-HDONN has digital-comparable
accuracy on various task adaptations with 74x faster speed and 194x lower
energy. Compared to prior DONNs, MDR-HDONN shows exponentially larger
functional space with 5x faster training speed, paving the way for a new
paradigm of versatile, composable, hybrid optical/photonic AI computing. We
will open-source our codes.

**Abstract**: Port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs) are emerging as a powerful modeling
tool that integrates physical laws with deep learning techniques. While most
research has focused on modeling the entire dynamics of interconnected systems,
the potential for identifying and modeling individual subsystems while
operating as part of a larger system has been overlooked. This study addresses
this gap by introducing a novel method for using pHNNs to identify such
subsystems based solely on input-output measurements. By utilizing the inherent
compositional property of the port-Hamiltonian systems, we developed an
algorithm that learns the dynamics of individual subsystems, without requiring
direct access to their internal states. On top of that, by choosing an output
error (OE) model structure, we have been able to handle measurement noise
effectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through
tests on interconnected systems, including multi-physics scenarios,
demonstrating its potential for identifying subsystem dynamics and facilitating
their integration into new interconnected models.

**PDF Url**: [2411.05728v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05728v1)

**Abstract**: We report on the emergence of a highly non-classical collective behavior in
quantum parametric oscillators, which we name quantum hyperspin, induced by a
tailored nonlinear interaction. This is the second quantized version of
classical multidimensional spherical spins, as XY spins in two dimensions, and
Heisenberg spins in three dimensions. In the phase space, the quantum
hyperspins are represented as spherical shells whose radius scales with the
number of particles in a way such that it cannot be factorized even in the
limit of large particle number. We show that the nonlinearly coupled quantum
oscillators form a high-dimensional entangled state that is surprisingly robust
with respect to the coupling with the environment. Such a behavior results from
a properly engineered reservoir. Networks of entangled quantum hyperspins are a
new approach to quantum simulations for applications in computing, Ising
machines, and high-energy physics models. We analyze from first principles
through ab initio numerical simulations the properties of quantum hyperspins,
including the interplay of entanglement and coupling frustration.


### Process tensor distinguishability measures

**PDF Url**: [2407.15712v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15712v2)

**Abstract**: Process tensors are quantum combs describing the evolution of open quantum
systems through multiple steps of a quantum dynamics. While there is more than
one way to measure how different two processes are, special care must be taken
to ensure quantifiers obey physically desirable conditions such as data
processing inequalities. Here, we analyze two classes of distinguishability
measures commonly used in general applications of quantum combs. We show that
the first class, called Choi divergences, does not satisfy an important data
processing inequality, while the second one, which we call generalized
divergences, does. We also extend to quantum combs some other relevant results
of generalized divergences of quantum channels. Finally, given the properties
we proved, we argue that generalized divergences may be more adequate than Choi
divergences for distinguishing quantum combs in most of their applications.
Particularly, this is crucial for defining monotones for resource theories
whose states have a comb structure, such as resource theories of quantum
processes and resource theories of quantum strategies.

**Abstract**: The escalating challenges of traffic congestion and environmental degradation
underscore the critical importance of embracing E-Mobility solutions in urban
spaces. In particular, micro E-Mobility tools such as E-scooters and E-bikes,
play a pivotal role in this transition, offering sustainable alternatives for
urban commuters. However, the energy consumption patterns for these tools are a
critical aspect that impacts their effectiveness in real-world scenarios and is
essential for trip planning and boosting user confidence in using these. To
this effect, recent studies have utilised physical models customised for
specific mobility tools and conditions, but these models struggle with
generalization and effectiveness in real-world scenarios due to a notable
absence of open datasets for thorough model evaluation and verification. To
fill this gap, our work presents an open dataset, collected in Dublin, Ireland,
specifically designed for energy modelling research related to E-Scooters and
E-Bikes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption
modelling based on the dataset using a set of representative machine learning
algorithms and compare their performance against the contemporary mathematical
models as a baseline. Our results demonstrate a notable advantage for
data-driven models in comparison to the corresponding mathematical models for
estimating energy consumption. Specifically, data-driven models outperform
physical models in accuracy by up to 83.83% for E-Bikes and 82.16% for
E-Scooters based on an in-depth analysis of the dataset under certain
assumptions.

**Abstract**: Fiber tractography is a cornerstone of neuroimaging, enabling the detailed
mapping of the brain's white matter pathways through diffusion MRI. This is
crucial for understanding brain connectivity and function, making it a valuable
tool in neurological applications. Despite its importance, tractography faces
challenges due to its complexity and susceptibility to false positives,
misrepresenting vital pathways. To address these issues, recent strategies have
shifted towards deep learning, utilizing supervised learning, which depends on
precise ground truth, or reinforcement learning, which operates without it. In
this work, we propose Tract-RLFormer, a network utilizing both supervised and
reinforcement learning, in a two-stage policy refinement process that markedly
improves the accuracy and generalizability across various data-sets. By
employing a tract-specific approach, our network directly delineates the tracts
of interest, bypassing the traditional segmentation process. Through rigorous
validation on datasets such as TractoInferno, HCP, and ISMRM-2015, our
methodology demonstrates a leap forward in tractography, showcasing its ability
to accurately map the brain's white matter tracts.


### Improving Molecular Graph Generation with Flow Matching and Optimal Transport

**PDF Url**: [2411.05676v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05676v1)

**Abstract**: Generating molecular graphs is crucial in drug design and discovery but
remains challenging due to the complex interdependencies between nodes and
edges. While diffusion models have demonstrated their potentiality in molecular
graph design, they often suffer from unstable training and inefficient
sampling. To enhance generation performance and training stability, we propose
GGFlow, a discrete flow matching generative model incorporating optimal
transport for molecular graphs and it incorporates an edge-augmented graph
transformer to enable the direct communications among chemical bounds.
Additionally, GGFlow introduces a novel goal-guided generation framework to
control the generative trajectory of our model, aiming to design novel
molecular structures with the desired properties. GGFlow demonstrates superior
performance on both unconditional and conditional molecule generation tasks,
outperforming existing baselines and underscoring its effectiveness and
potential for wider application.

**Abstract**: Battery degradation remains a critical challenge in the pursuit of green
technologies and sustainable energy solutions. Despite significant research
efforts, predicting battery capacity loss accurately remains a formidable task
due to its complex nature, influenced by both aging and cycling behaviors. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel general-purpose model for battery
degradation prediction and synthesis, DiffBatt. Leveraging an innovative
combination of conditional and unconditional diffusion models with
classifier-free guidance and transformer architecture, DiffBatt achieves high
expressivity and scalability. DiffBatt operates as a probabilistic model to
capture uncertainty in aging behaviors and a generative model to simulate
battery degradation. The performance of the model excels in prediction tasks
while also enabling the generation of synthetic degradation curves,
facilitating enhanced model training by data augmentation. In the remaining
useful life prediction task, DiffBatt provides accurate results with a mean
RMSE of 196 cycles across all datasets, outperforming all other models and
demonstrating superior generalizability. This work represents an important step
towards developing foundational models for battery degradation.

**Abstract**: With the significant advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) and the
proliferation of mobile devices, providing high-quality AIGC services via
wireless networks is becoming the future direction. However, the primary
challenges of AIGC services provisioning in wireless networks lie in unstable
channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational
resources. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication
(SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where
only semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should
be generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates
diffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a
workload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational
resource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a Resource-aware wOrklOad
Trade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation
decisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and
fine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service
requirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC
framework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional
approaches.

**Abstract**: Lifelong few-shot customization for text-to-image diffusion aims to
continually generalize existing models for new tasks with minimal data while
preserving old knowledge. Current customization diffusion models excel in
few-shot tasks but struggle with catastrophic forgetting problems in lifelong
generations. In this study, we identify and categorize the catastrophic
forgetting problems into two folds: relevant concepts forgetting and previous
concepts forgetting. To address these challenges, we first devise a data-free
knowledge distillation strategy to tackle relevant concepts forgetting. Unlike
existing methods that rely on additional real data or offline replay of
original concept data, our approach enables on-the-fly knowledge distillation
to retain the previous concepts while learning new ones, without accessing any
previous data. Second, we develop an In-Context Generation (ICGen) paradigm
that allows the diffusion model to be conditioned upon the input vision
context, which facilitates the few-shot generation and mitigates the issue of
previous concepts forgetting. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
Lifelong Few-Shot Diffusion (LFS-Diffusion) method can produce high-quality and
accurate images while maintaining previously learned knowledge.
