**Abstract**: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter
(DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly
compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions,
halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the
central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse
phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand
numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better
understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body
simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external
gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of
the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to
energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially
speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can
describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have
simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we
make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the
current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late
collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g.
that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to
run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations
of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.

**Abstract**: We present a modified Marrone-Treanor (MMT) model for dissociation with rate
parameters derived exclusively from quasiclassical trajectory (QCT)
calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). Analysis of the QCT
dataset for reactant O2 and N2 diatoms sampled from Boltzmann internal energy
distributions over a wide (T,Tv)-range indicates that a modified version of the
classical Marrone-Treanor two-temperature model captures the most relevant
physics of shock-heated dissociating diatomic species very well. We find that
simple correction factors account for non-Boltzmann depletion effects observed
in direct molecular simulations (DMS) employing the same PESs. The
concentration-dependent functional form proposed for these correction factors
ensures that depletion effects vanish at chemical equilibrium. Based on
comparisons in isothermal and adiabatic heat baths we verify that the resulting
MMT model accurately reproduces all major features observed in DMS, while
remaining computationally inexpensive enough for large-scale computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.


### Can Theoretical Physics Research Benefit from Language Agents?

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains,
yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This
position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate
theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with
domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics
-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in
physics.


### How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time
**Authors**: Joaquin Garcia-Suarez

**Published Date**: 2025-04-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2504.04822v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04822v3)

**Abstract**: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave
propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across
the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths
($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a
certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each
individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of
transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique
is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in
frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the
finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their
associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths
to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this
''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix
numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling
substantial computational savings.


### Beyond the Projection Postulate and Back: Quantum Theories with Generalised State-Update Rules
**Authors**: Vincenzo Fiorentino, Stefan Weigert

**Published Date**: 2025-06-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2506.06207v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06207v1)

**Abstract**: Are there consistent and physically reasonable alternatives to the projection
postulate? Does it have unique properties compared to acceptable alternatives?
We answer these questions by systematically investigating hypothetical
state-update rules for quantum systems that nature could have chosen over the
L\"uders rule. Among other basic properties, any prospective rule must define
unique post-measurement states and not allow for superluminal signalling.
Particular attention will be paid to consistently defining post-measurement
states when performing local measurements in composite systems. Explicit
examples of valid unconventional update rules are presented, each of them
resulting in a distinct, well-defined foil of quantum theory. This framework of
state-update rules allows us to identify operational properties that
distinguish the projective update rule from all others and to put earlier
derivations of the projection postulate into perspective.


### Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production
**Authors**: Mark P. Hertzberg, Abraham Loeb

**Published Date**: 2023-07-09

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2307.05243v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05243v2)

**Abstract**: We study the recent Physical Review Letter [1] which presents a new mechanism
for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially
dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result
near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small
correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter
space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally
coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle
production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars,
it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for
conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed
productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the
proposed formalism.


### Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Control of Single-Phase Flow Systems Governed by Partial Differential Equations

**PDF Url**: [2506.06188v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06188v1)

**Abstract**: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.


### Taylor Series Kinematics

**PDF Url**: [2506.06170v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06170v1)

**Abstract**: Has it ever occurred to you that the kinematic equations for uniformly
accelerated one-dimensional motion are Taylor series expansions? If not, you
are in good company. I didn't know this myself until a colleague pointed it out
to me many years ago, and I was stunned to learn something new and wonderful
about something so familiar. Accordingly, my first objective in this paper is
to clearly present the not-widely-known Taylor series derivations of these
basic equations to a population primed to deeply appreciate them: people, like
me, who teach introductory physics. Following this, I use the Taylor series
approach to derive a generalized one-dimensional expression for x(t) that
includes the jerk and further kinematic time derivatives, which have importance
in many real-world applications and in which there has been renewed pedagogical
interest. I also outline teaching suggestions and provide student-accessible
video derivations to support instructors who would like to incorporate Taylor
series kinematics into their teaching, while identifying sequencing-related
challenges. I close with the observation that the traditional second calculus
course, which is largely free of sequencing issues, could be a great place to
incorporate and leverage Taylor series kinematics, and I briefly outline an
early-stage pilot collaboration to explore this possibility.


### Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics
**Authors**: Michael J. Quin, Antonino Di Piazza, Christoph H. Keitel, Matteo Tamburini

**Published Date**: 2023-06-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2306.17832v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17832v4)

**Abstract**: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field
can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where the adiation
reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are
often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle
fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during
coherent emission. Here we present (i) an analytical proof showing that the
energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which
is divergence free and describes a generic system of interacting charges,
respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple
generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of
the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By
performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic
bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this
theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle
fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined
effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the
particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations
show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes
smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.


### ENMA: Tokenwise Autoregression for Generative Neural PDE Operators

**PDF Url**: [2506.06158v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06158v1)

**Abstract**: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.


## Diffusion
### Normalizing Flows are Capable Generative Models
**Authors**: Shuangfei Zhai, Ruixiang Zhang, Preetum Nakkiran, David Berthelot, Jiatao Gu, Huangjie Zheng, Tianrong Chen, Miguel Angel Bautista, Navdeep Jaitly, Josh Susskind

**Abstract**: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are likelihood-based models for continuous inputs.
They have demonstrated promising results on both density estimation and
generative modeling tasks, but have received relatively little attention in
recent years. In this work, we demonstrate that NFs are more powerful than
previously believed. We present TarFlow: a simple and scalable architecture
that enables highly performant NF models. TarFlow can be thought of as a
Transformer-based variant of Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): it consists of
a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches, alternating the
autoregression direction between layers. TarFlow is straightforward to train
end-to-end, and capable of directly modeling and generating pixels. We also
propose three key techniques to improve sample quality: Gaussian noise
augmentation during training, a post training denoising procedure, and an
effective guidance method for both class-conditional and unconditional
settings. Putting these together, TarFlow sets new state-of-the-art results on
likelihood estimation for images, beating the previous best methods by a large
margin, and generates samples with quality and diversity comparable to
diffusion models, for the first time with a stand-alone NF model. We make our
code available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tarflow.


### GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval
**Authors**: Diji Yang, Minghao Liu, Chung-Hsiang Lo, Yi Zhang, James Davis

**Published Date**: 2025-06-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2506.06220v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06220v1)

**Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.


### Antithetic Noise in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jing Jia, Sifan Liu, Bowen Song, Wei Yuan, Liyue Shen, Guanyang Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-06-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2506.06185v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06185v1)

**Abstract**: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of
producing high-quality contents such as images, videos, and audio,
demonstrating their potential to revolutionize digital content creation.
However, these capabilities come at the cost of their significant computational
resources and lengthy generation time, underscoring the critical need to
develop efficient techniques for practical deployment. In this survey, we
provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research on efficient
diffusion models. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three
main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient diffusion model
topics from algorithm-level, system-level, and framework perspective,
respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the
papers featured in this survey at
https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey. We hope our
survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners
gain a systematic understanding of efficient diffusion model research and
inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field.


### Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient for Inference Trajectory Optimization in Flow and Diffusion
**Authors**: Dohoon Lee, Jaehyun Park, Hyunwoo J. Kim, Kyogu Lee

**Published Date**: 2024-04-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-06

**PDF Url**: [2404.14161v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14161v3)

**Abstract**: Flow and diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance and training
stability across various tasks but lack two critical properties of
simulation-based methods: freedom of dimensionality and adaptability to
different inference trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose the
Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and
diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to
multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is
trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical
results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances
generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers
a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future
research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient,
simulation-based optimization.
