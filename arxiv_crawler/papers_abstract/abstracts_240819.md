**Abstract**: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature:
under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they
vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the
context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a
lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and
umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of
two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives
rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this
context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that
either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside
the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an
umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being
smaller than a critical value.

**Abstract**: Cold atoms in optical lattice represent a quantum system of fundamental
importance as they enable the study of many-body physics in a controllable way.
It is thus essential to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore
quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body
interactions. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of
quantum entanglement via e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical
demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body
quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion
characterizing collective entanglement among lattice sites and enabling
experimental observation readily. Our criterion witnesses phase transitions
such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave
transitions in a measurable way and can be experimentally tested via Raman
scattering or time-of-flight expansion approach thus within the reach of
current technology.


### Combination of searches for singly produced vector-like top quarks in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector
**Authors**: ATLAS Collaboration

**Published Date**: 2024-08-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.08789v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08789v1)

**Abstract**: A combination of searches for the single production of vector-like top quarks
($T$) is presented. These analyses are based on proton$-$proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded in 2015$-$2018 with the ATLAS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$.
The $T$-quark decay modes considered in this combination are into a top quark
and either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a $Z$ boson ($T \to Ht$ and $T \to
Zt$). The individual searches used in the combination are differentiated by the
number of leptons ($e$, $\mu$) in the final state. The observed data are found
to be in good agreement with the Standard Model background prediction.
Interpretations are provided for a range of masses and couplings of the
vector-like top quark for benchmark models and generalized representations in
terms of 95% confidence level limits. For a benchmark signal prediction of a
vector-like top quark SU2 singlet with electroweak coupling, $\kappa$, of 0.5,
masses below 2.1 TeV are excluded, resulting in the most restrictive limits to
date.


### The Born rule for quantum probabilities from Newton's third law
**Authors**: S. S. Afonin

**Published Date**: 2024-06-24

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.03941v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03941v2)

**Abstract**: According to the Born rule, the probability density in quantum theory is
determined by the square of the wave function. A generally accepted derivation
of this rule has not yet been proposed. In the given work, a simple physical
picture is constructed within which the Born rule arises in a natural way. In
the proposed scheme, the interaction of a particle with a measuring apparatus
is equivalent to creation of a "mirror image" of particle wave function in the
space region of interaction. The observable quantity is the product of the
particle wave function and its "image". The phase of the latter is reversed due
to Newton's third law, thus leading to the Born rule.


### Plasma Rotation Induced by Biasing in Axially Symmetric Mirrors
**Authors**: Alexei D. Beklemishev

**Published Date**: 2024-08-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.08777v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08777v1)

**Abstract**: Physics of the plasma rotation driven by biasing in linear traps is analyzed
for two limiting cases. The first, relevant for traps with decent plasma
parameters, considers the line-tying effects to be responsible for the drive as
well as for the dissipation of the angular momentum. Meanwhile, in long and
thin traps with low plasma parameters or developed turbulence the radial
transport of the angular momentum becomes its primary loss channel. The
momentum flux goes into the scrape-off layer; that makes conditions there
partially responsible for the achievable rotation limits.

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2401.00522v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00522v2)

**Abstract**: This study focuses on precisely calculating analytical critical points for
rotating regular AdS black holes, examining scenarios with and without external
dark field contributions. Importantly, it represents the first attempt to
compute critical points for this specific class of rotating black holes. Our
primary focus is on investigating the impact resulting from variations in the
charge of nonlinear electrodynamics on the critical phenomena of rotating
regular AdS black holes, while also incorporating the influence of quintessence
field contributions. The analytical investigation is concentrated on the
horizon radius, employing two distinct approaches to simplify the complexity
and length of the calculations. Furthermore, our examination extends to
deciphering the intricate relationship between dark energy and critical
phenomena. This involves visually portraying a range of critical behaviors and
detailing a recent discovery regarding how the intensity of quintessence
affects phase transitions. The shift in these transitions conform to either a
concave or convex function, a characteristic dependent on the sign of
quintessence intensity.


### Violation of causality in $f(Q)$ gravity
**Authors**: A. M. Silva, M. J. Rebouças, N. A. Lemos

**PDF Url**: [2407.04750v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04750v2)

**Abstract**: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The
nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been
proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing
challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have
already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for
astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type
spacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological
solutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is
shown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are
satisfied, we find that G\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified
gravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. As a matter of fact, out of all
G\"odel-type metrics only G\"odel's original model is compatible with $f(Q)$
gravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy
conditions be obeyed by the matter content leads to mild restrictions on the
function $f(Q)$.


### Towards Higgs and $Z$ boson plus jet distributions at NLL/NLO$^+$
**Authors**: Francesco Giovanni Celiberto, Luigi Delle Rose, Michael Fucilla, Gabriele Gatto, Alessandro Papa

**Published Date**: 2024-08-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.08757v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08757v1)

**Abstract**: We present novel predictions for rapidity and transverse-momentum
distributions sensitive to the emission of a Higgs boson accompanied by a jet
in proton collisions, calculated within the NLO fixed order in QCD and matched
with the next-to leading energy-logarithmic accuracy. We also highlight first
advancements in the extension of our analysis to the $Z$-boson case. We come
out with the message that the improvement of fixed-order calculations on Higgs-
and $Z$-boson plus jet distributions is a required step to reach the precision
level of the description of observables relevant for Higgs and electroweak
physics at current LHC energies and nominal FCC ones.


### Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry
**Authors**: Maarten Grothus, V. Vilasini

**Published Date**: 2024-03-01

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2403.00916v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00916v2)

**Abstract**: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in
different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to
the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging
a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects
these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here,
information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach.
First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as
defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide
conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation,
introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where
the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In
particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the
absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an
order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for
light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d>1$ spatial dimensions but violated
for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal
models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no
superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed
by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal
inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical
space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel
between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between
informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for
studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in
different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.


### Higgs production at NLL accuracy in the BFKL approach
**Authors**: Francesco Giovanni Celiberto, Luigi Delle Rose, Michael Fucilla, Gabriele Gatto, Dmitry Yu. Ivanov, Mohammed M. A. Mohammed, Alessandro Papa

**Published Date**: 2024-08-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.08731v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08731v1)

**Abstract**: Precision physics in the Higgs sector has been one of the main challenges of
particle physics in the recent years. The pure fixed-order calculations
entering the collinear factorization framework, which have been pushed up to
next-cube-leading-order, are not able to describe the entire kinematic
spectrum. In particular sectors, they have to be necessarily enhanced by
all-order resummations. In the so-called semi-hard regime, large energy-type
logarithms spoil the perturbative convergence of the series and must be
resummed to all orders. This resummation is a core ingredient for a correct
description of the inclusive hadroproduction of a forward Higgs boson in the
limit of small Bjorken $x$, as well as for a precision study of inclusive
forward emissions of a Higgs boson in association with a backward identified
object. A complete resummation for these processes can be achieved at the at
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy thanks to the
Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov approach. In the present work we present and
discuss a series of recent phenomenological results within a partial
next-to-leading accuracy. They include the analysis of rapidity and
azimuthal-angle differential rates for Higgs plus jet and Higgs plus charm
reactions in forward and ultraforward directions of rapidity at the LHC.


## Diffusion

**Authors**: François Rozet, Gérôme Andry, François Lanusse, Gilles Louppe

**Published Date**: 2024-05-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2405.13712v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13712v3)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse
problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large
amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this
work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm
for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only.
Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is
crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate an
improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We
present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.


### CollaFuse: Navigating Limited Resources and Privacy in Collaborative Generative AI
**Authors**: Domenique Zipperling, Simeon Allmendinger, Lukas Struppek, Niklas Kühl

**Published Date**: 2024-02-29

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2402.19105v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19105v2)

**Abstract**: In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based
models present challenges for socio-technical systems in data requirements and
privacy. Traditional approaches like federated learning distribute the learning
process but strain individual clients, especially with constrained resources
(e.g., edge devices). In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse,
a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and
collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse
enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational
burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU
processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally
expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context,
CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive
information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various
application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare
research, or autonomous driving. In essence, our work advances distributed
machine learning, shaping the future of collaborative GenAI networks.


### Modeling the Neonatal Brain Development Using Implicit Neural Representations
**Authors**: Florentin Bieder, Paul Friedrich, Hélène Corbaz, Alicia Durrer, Julia Wolleb, Philippe C. Cattin

**Published Date**: 2024-08-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.08647v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08647v1)

**Abstract**: The human brain undergoes rapid development during the third trimester of
pregnancy. In this work, we model the neonatal development of the infant brain
in this age range. As a basis, we use MR images of preterm- and term-birth
neonates from the developing human connectome project (dHCP). We propose a
neural network, specifically an implicit neural representation (INR), to
predict 2D- and 3D images of varying time points. In order to model a
subject-specific development process, it is necessary to disentangle the age
from the subjects' identity in the latent space of the INR. We propose two
methods, Subject Specific Latent Vectors (SSL) and Stochastic Global Latent
Augmentation (SGLA), enabling this disentanglement. We perform an analysis of
the results and compare our proposed model to an age-conditioned denoising
diffusion model as a baseline. We also show that our method can be applied in a
memory-efficient way, which is especially important for 3D data.


### Generative Dataset Distillation Based on Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Duo Su, Junjie Hou, Guang Li, Ren Togo, Rui Song, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama

**Published Date**: 2024-08-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2408.08610v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08610v1)

**Abstract**: This paper presents our method for the generative track of The First Dataset
Distillation Challenge at ECCV 2024. Since the diffusion model has become the
mainstay of generative models because of its high-quality generative effects,
we focus on distillation methods based on the diffusion model. Considering that
the track can only generate a fixed number of images in 10 minutes using a
generative model for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we need to use a
generative model that can generate images at high speed. In this study, we
proposed a novel generative dataset distillation method based on Stable
Diffusion. Specifically, we use the SDXL-Turbo model which can generate images
at high speed and quality. Compared to other diffusion models that can only
generate images per class (IPC) = 1, our method can achieve an IPC = 10 for
Tiny-ImageNet and an IPC = 20 for CIFAR-100, respectively. Additionally, to
generate high-quality distilled datasets for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we
use the class information as text prompts and post data augmentation for the
SDXL-Turbo model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed
method, and we achieved third place in the generative track of the ECCV 2024 DD
Challenge. Codes are available at https://github.com/Guang000/BANKO.


### Fair Sampling in Diffusion Models through Switching Mechanism
**Authors**: Yujin Choi, Jinseong Park, Hoki Kim, Jaewook Lee, Saeroom Park

**Published Date**: 2024-01-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-16

**PDF Url**: [2401.03140v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03140v4)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by
well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion
models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training
data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can
be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find
empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this
limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called
\textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional
training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated
data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i)
the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the
generated data.
