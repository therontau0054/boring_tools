**Abstract**: In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by
gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we
recently demonstrated in the context of the $U\left(1\right)$ and
$SU\left(2\right)$ Higgs models
\cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of
gauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known
gauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their
K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively.
Despite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as
elementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their
computation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to
compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This
trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to
the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the
traditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary
fields.

**Abstract**: We consider a generic class of effective quantum field theories with
arbitrary gauge groups and scalar matter fields. In such theories, we derive
the one-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) for the physical
dimension-six operators. The present paper is the first one in a series that is
going to cover theories with spin-$\frac12$ matter fields, too, including the
phenomenologically most relevant SMEFT and LEFT cases. Our present approach
provides tools for deriving the yet unknown two-loop RGEs in the SMEFT.

**PDF Url**: [2501.17110v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17110v1)

**Abstract**: We consider the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) or Neural Networks (NNs) to
numerically approximate the solutions to nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) with rough forcing or source terms, which commonly arise as
pathwise solutions to stochastic PDEs. Kernel methods have recently been
generalized to solve nonlinear PDEs by approximating their solutions as the
maximum a posteriori estimator of GPs that are conditioned to satisfy the PDE
at a finite set of collocation points. The convergence and error guarantees of
these methods, however, rely on the PDE being defined in a classical sense and
its solution possessing sufficient regularity to belong to the associated
reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose a generalization of these methods
to handle roughly forced nonlinear PDEs while preserving convergence guarantees
with an oversmoothing GP kernel that is misspecified relative to the true
solution's regularity. This is achieved by conditioning a regular GP to satisfy
the PDE with a modified source term in a weak sense (when integrated against a
finite number of test functions). This is equivalent to replacing the empirical
$L^2$-loss on the PDE constraint by an empirical negative-Sobolev norm. We
further show that this loss function can be used to extend physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) to stochastic equations, thereby resulting in a new
NN-based variant termed Negative Sobolev Norm-PINN (NeS-PINN).


### Elastic Neutrino-electron Scattering at the One-loop Level in the Standard Model
**Authors**: Jihong Huang, Shun Zhou

**PDF Url**: [2412.17047v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17047v2)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we perform a complete calculation of the differential cross
section for elastic neutrino-electron scattering at the one-loop level in the
Standard Model (SM), by using up-to-date values of relevant input parameters in
the on-shell renormalization scheme. A careful comparison with the calculation
done by Sarantakos, Sirlin and Marciano more than forty years ago in the same
scheme is carried out, and an excellent agreement is found if the same values
of input parameters are taken. Then we apply our results to compute the event
rates for the detection of reactor antineutrinos in both JUNO and TAO
experiments, which are now under construction and will soon be in operation. It
should be emphasized that one-loop radiative corrections in the SM must be
taken into account in the first place when searching for possible new-physics
effects in the coming era of precision neutrino physics.


### The physical basis of teleological evolutions
**Authors**: Giuseppe Castagnoli

**Published Date**: 2023-10-29

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2310.18927v12](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18927v12)

**Abstract**: We show that the sheer existence of a quantum computational speedup logically
implies the mutually exclusive or of well-defined causal loops. In each of
them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance one of the possible halves
of the information about the solution she will produce and measure in the
future and could use this knowledge to produce the solution with fewer
computation steps. Involving only the measurements of commuting observables,
quantum algorithms are submitted to the same (classical) logic and should
therefore host the quantum superposition of the causal loops in question.
However, their ordinary quantum description does not and, being causal in
character, cannot describe causal loops. It must therefore be incomplete and is
in fact completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the unitary part of the
ordinary quantum description of the quantum algorithm mathematically unaltered
but changes the behavior of causality along it. The single causal process of
the ordinary quantum superposition is replaced by the quantum superposition of
the causal loops in question. In their completed quantum description, quantum
algorithms respond to the pre-scientific notion of teleological evolution, that
is, an evolution toward a goal (the solution) with an attractor in the goal it
will produce in the future (the solution again). Once applied to the evolutions
of the living, this notion was dismissed with the advent of modern science for
the alleged absence of a physical basis. We show that, under a quantum
cosmological interpretation of the Anthropic Principle, the same quantum
superposition of causal loops underlying the teleological character of quantum
algorithms becomes the missing physical basis of the teleological character of
natural evolutions.


### Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals
**Authors**: Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco

**Abstract**: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel
functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch
states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical
properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the
Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as
pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their
formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of
Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids
that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of
bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to
finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and
use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of
full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated,
absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a
wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of
the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely
optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states
while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band
structure.


### Wormholes, branes and finite matrices in sine dilaton gravity
**Authors**: Andreas Blommaert, Adam Levine, Thomas G. Mertens, Jacopo Papalini, Klaas Parmentier

**Published Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2501.17091v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17091v1)

**Abstract**: We compute the double trumpet in sine dilaton gravity via WdW quantization.
The wormhole size is discretized. The wormhole amplitude matches the spectral
correlation of a finite-cut matrix integral, where matrices have large but
finite dimensions. This strongly suggests an identification of the sine dilaton
gravity theory with the q-deformed JT gravity matrix integral. At the very
least, it captures all universal content of that matrix model. The disk
decomposes into the physical (gauge invariant) solutions of the WdW equation,
which are trumpets with discrete sizes. This decomposition modifies the usual
no-boundary wavefunction to a normalizable one in sine dilaton gravity. We
furthermore present an exact quantization of sine dilaton gravity with open and
closed end of the world branes. These EOW branes correspond with FZZT branes
for the two Liouville theories that make up sine dilaton gravity. The WdW
equation implies redundancies in this space of branes, leaving a one parameter
family of gauge invariant branes. One gauge choice corresponds with branes
discussed by Okuyama in the context of chord diagrams and of DSSYK. Legendre
transforming the EOW brane amplitude reproduces the trumpet, independent of the
WdW quantization calculation. One could read our work as fleshing out the
Hilbert space of closed universes in sine dilaton gravity.


### Graph Transformers for inverse physics: reconstructing flows around arbitrary 2D airfoils
**Authors**: Gregory Duthé, Imad Abdallah, Eleni Chatzi

**Published Date**: 2025-01-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2501.17081v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17081v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a Graph Transformer framework that serves as a general inverse
physics engine on meshes, demonstrated through the challenging task of
reconstructing aerodynamic flow fields from sparse surface measurements. While
deep learning has shown promising results in forward physics simulation,
inverse problems remain particularly challenging due to their ill-posed nature
and the difficulty of propagating information from limited boundary
observations. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining the
geometric expressiveness of message-passing neural networks with the global
reasoning of Transformers, enabling efficient learning of inverse mappings from
boundary conditions to complete states. We evaluate this framework on a
comprehensive dataset of steady-state RANS simulations around diverse airfoil
geometries, where the task is to reconstruct full pressure and velocity fields
from surface pressure measurements alone. The architecture achieves high
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. We conduct
experiments and provide insights into the relative importance of local
geometric processing and global attention mechanisms in mesh-based inverse
problems. We also find that the framework is robust to reduced sensor coverage.
These results suggest that Graph Transformers can serve as effective inverse
physics engines across a broader range of applications where complete system
states must be reconstructed from limited boundary observations.


### Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil
**Authors**: Stéphane Poulain, Timo Koch, L. Mahadevan, Andreas Carlson

**Published Date**: 2025-01-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2501.17080v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17080v1)

**Abstract**: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited
elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we
develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects.
Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic
deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the
intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible
forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the
forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall.
A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and
the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface.
Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical
predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain
the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.


### Fingering instability of self-similar radial flow of miscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell
**Authors**: John R. Lister, Tim-Frederik Dauck

**Published Date**: 2024-12-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2412.01961v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01961v2)

**Abstract**: The linear stability of miscible displacement for radial source flow at
infinite P\'eclet number in a Hele-Shaw cell is calculated theoretically. The
axisymmetric self-similar flow is shown to be unstable to viscous fingering if
the viscosity ratio $m$ between ambient and injected fluids exceeds $3\over2$
and to be stable if $m<{3\over2}$. If $1<m<{3\over2}$ small disturbances decay
at rates between $t^{-3/4}$ and $t^{-1}$ relative to the $t^{1/2}$ radius of
the axisymmetric base-state similarity solution; if $m<1$ they decay faster
than $t^{-1}$. Asymptotic analysis confirms these results and gives physical
insight into various features of the numerically determined relationship
between the growth rate and the azimuthal wavenumber and viscosity ratio.


## Diffusion
### CubeDiff: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Models for Panorama Generation
**Authors**: Nikolai Kalischek, Michael Oechsle, Fabian Manhardt, Philipp Henzler, Konrad Schindler, Federico Tombari

**Published Date**: 2025-01-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2501.17162v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17162v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a novel method for generating 360{\deg} panoramas from text
prompts or images. Our approach leverages recent advances in 3D generation by
employing multi-view diffusion models to jointly synthesize the six faces of a
cubemap. Unlike previous methods that rely on processing equirectangular
projections or autoregressive generation, our method treats each face as a
standard perspective image, simplifying the generation process and enabling the
use of existing multi-view diffusion models. We demonstrate that these models
can be adapted to produce high-quality cubemaps without requiring
correspondence-aware attention layers. Our model allows for fine-grained text
control, generates high resolution panorama images and generalizes well beyond
its training set, whilst achieving state-of-the-art results, both qualitatively
and quantitatively. Project page: https://cubediff.github.io/


### Three-Dimensional Diffusion-Weighted Multi-Slab MRI With Slice Profile Compensation Using Deep Energy Model
**Authors**: Reza Ghorbani, Jyothi Rikhab Chand, Chu-Yu Lee, Mathews Jacob, Merry Mani

**Published Date**: 2025-01-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-28

**PDF Url**: [2501.17152v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17152v1)

**Abstract**: Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab acquisition is a technique frequently
employed in high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI in order to achieve the best
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. However, this technique is limited by
slab boundary artifacts that cause intensity fluctuations and aliasing between
slabs which reduces the accuracy of anatomical imaging. Addressing this issue
is crucial for advancing diffusion MRI quality and making high-resolution
imaging more feasible for clinical and research applications. In this work, we
propose a regularized slab profile encoding (PEN) method within a Plug-and-Play
ADMM framework, incorporating multi-scale energy (MuSE) regularization to
effectively improve the slab combined reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves image quality
compared to non-regularized and TV-regularized PEN approaches. The regularized
PEN framework provides a more robust and efficient solution for high-resolution
3D diffusion MRI, potentially enabling clearer, more reliable anatomical
imaging across various applications.


### Text-to-Image Generation for Vocabulary Learning Using the Keyword Method

**Abstract**: The 'keyword method' is an effective technique for learning vocabulary of a
foreign language. It involves creating a memorable visual link between what a
word means and what its pronunciation in a foreign language sounds like in the
learner's native language. However, these memorable visual links remain
implicit in the people's mind and are not easy to remember for a large set of
words. To enhance the memorisation and recall of the vocabulary, we developed
an application that combines the keyword method with text-to-image generators
to externalise the memorable visual links into visuals. These visuals represent
additional stimuli during the memorisation process. To explore the
effectiveness of this approach we first run a pilot study to investigate how
difficult it is to externalise the descriptions of mental visualisations of
memorable links, by asking participants to write them down. We used these
descriptions as prompts for text-to-image generator (DALL-E2) to convert them
into images and asked participants to select their favourites. Next, we
compared different text-to-image generators (DALL-E2, Midjourney, Stable and
Latent Diffusion) to evaluate the perceived quality of the generated images by
each. Despite heterogeneous results, participants mostly preferred images
generated by DALL-E2, which was used also for the final study. In this study,
we investigated whether providing such images enhances the retention of
vocabulary being learned, compared to the keyword method only. Our results
indicate that people did not encounter difficulties describing their
visualisations of memorable links and that providing corresponding images
significantly improves memory retention.


### On AI-Inspired UI-Design

**Abstract**: Graphical User Interface (or simply UI) is a primary mean of interaction
between users and their devices. In this paper, we discuss three complementary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for triggering the creativity of app
designers and inspiring them create better and more diverse UI designs. First,
designers can prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly generate and
adjust UIs. Second, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) enables designers to
effectively search a large screenshot dataset, e.g. from apps published in app
stores. Third, a Diffusion Model (DM) can be trained to specifically generate
UIs as inspirational images. We present an AI-inspired design process and
discuss the implications and limitations of the approaches.


### Generative diffusion models from a PDE perspective
**Authors**: Fei Cao, Kimball Johnston, Thomas Laurent, Justin Le, Sébastien Motsch

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have become the de facto framework for generating new
datasets. The core of these models lies in the ability to reverse a diffusion
process in time. The goal of this manuscript is to explain, from a PDE
perspective, how this method works and how to derive the PDE governing the
reverse dynamics as well as to study its solution analytically. By linking
forward and reverse dynamics, we show that the reverse process's distribution
has its support contained within the original distribution. Consequently,
diffusion methods, in their analytical formulation, do not inherently
regularize the original distribution, and thus, there is no generalization
principle. This raises a question: where does generalization arise, given that
in practice it does occur? Moreover, we derive an explicit solution to the
reverse process's SDE under the assumption that the starting point of the
forward process is fixed. This provides a new derivation that links two popular
approaches to generative diffusion models: stable diffusion (discrete dynamics)
and the score-based approach (continuous dynamics). Finally, we explore the
case where the original distribution consists of a finite set of data points.
In this scenario, the reverse dynamics are explicit (i.e., the loss function
has a clear minimizer), and solving the dynamics fails to generate new samples:
the dynamics converge to the original samples. In a sense, solving the
minimization problem exactly is "too good for its own good" (i.e., an
overfitting regime).
