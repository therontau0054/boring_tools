**Abstract**: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic
devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance
compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a
DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in
devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and
measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a
TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating
reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced
from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach
enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design
strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry
constraints throughout optimization.

**Abstract**: The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains
challenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial
dimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this
end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation
protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources
required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work
introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states
based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which
provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate
highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The
algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA
techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical
simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to
accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial
insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian
states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical
upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that
are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for
implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a
foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a
novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological
order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations
with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.

**Abstract**: This paper examines the physical meaning of the wave function in Bohmian
mechanics (BM), addressing the debate between causal and nomological
interpretations. While BM postulates particles with definite trajectories
guided by the wave function, the ontological status of the wave function itself
remains contested. Critics of the causal interpretation argue that the wave
function's high-dimensionality and lack of back-reaction disqualify it as a
physical entity. Proponents of the nomological interpretation, drawing
parallels to the classical Hamiltonian, propose that the wave function is a
"law-like" entity. However, this view faces challenges, including reliance on
speculative quantum gravity frameworks (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) and
conceptual ambiguities about the nature of "nomological entities". By
systematically comparing BM to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, this paper highlights
disanalogies between the wave function and the classical action function. These
differences, particularly the wave function's dynamical necessity and
irreducibility, support a sui generis interpretation, where the wave function
represents a novel ontological category unique to quantum theory. The paper
concludes that the wave function's role in BM resists classical analogies,
demanding a metaphysical framework that accommodates its non-local,
high-dimensional, and dynamically irreducible nature.


### Physics-Constrained Flow Matching: Sampling Generative Models with Hard Constraints

**Abstract**: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation
and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such
as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains
challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural
biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose
Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that
enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative
models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based
corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned
with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM
outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs,
including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while
ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method
provides a general framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific
and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where
constraint satisfaction is essential.


### Is the end of Insight in Sight ?

**Abstract**: The rise of deep learning challenges the longstanding scientific ideal of
insight - the human capacity to understand phenomena by uncovering underlying
mechanisms. In many modern applications, accurate predictions no longer require
interpretable models, prompting debate about whether explainability is a
realistic or even meaningful goal. From our perspective in physics, we examine
this tension through a concrete case study: a physics-informed neural network
(PINN) trained on a rarefied gas dynamics problem governed by the Boltzmann
equation. Despite the system's clear structure and well-understood governing
laws, the trained network's weights resemble Gaussian-distributed random
matrices, with no evident trace of the physical principles involved. This
suggests that deep learning and traditional simulation may follow distinct
cognitive paths to the same outcome - one grounded in mechanistic insight, the
other in statistical interpolation. Our findings raise critical questions about
the limits of explainable AI and whether interpretability can - or
should-remain a universal standard in artificial reasoning.


### On computing quantum waves exactly from classical action
**Authors**: Winfried Lohmiller, Jean-Jacques Slotine

**Published Date**: 2024-05-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-04

**PDF Url**: [2405.06328v9](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06328v9)

**Abstract**: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics can be solved
exactly based only on classical least action and its associated classical
density.
  Most quantum mechanics problems have classical versions which involve
multiple least action solutions. These extremal action paths may stem from
spatial inequality constraints (as in the double slit experiment), from
singularities in the Hamiltonian (as in a Coulomb potential), from a closed
configuration manifold (as for a spinning particle), or just from the initial
action distribution. We show that the exact Schr\"odinger wave function $\Psi$
of the original quantum problem can be constructed by combining this classical
multi-valued action $\Phi$ with the density $\rho$ of the classical position
dynamics, which can be computed from $\Phi$ along each extremal action path.
This construction is general and does not involve any quasi-classical
approximation.
  Quantum wave collapse corresponds to transitioning between multi-valued
classical action branches at a branch point (e.g., position measurement), or to
measuring the classical eigendensity field (e.g., momentum or energy
measurement). Entanglement corresponds to a sum of classical individual
particle actions mapping to a tensor product of spinors.
  Examples illustrate how the quantum wave functions for the double-slit
experiment, the hydrogen atom, or EPR can be computed exactly from their
classical least action counterparts.
  These coordinate-invariant results provide a simpler computing alternative to
Feynman path integrals, as they use only a discrete set of classical paths and
avoid zig-zag paths and time-slicing altogether. They extend to the
relativistic Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation, and suggest a smooth transition
between physics across scales.

**PDF Url**: [2506.04132v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04132v1)

**Abstract**: We present a comprehensive investigation into plant bioelectric responses to
human presence and emotional states, building on five years of systematic
research. Using custom-built plant sensors and machine learning classification,
we demonstrate that plants generate distinct bioelectric signals correlating
with human proximity, emotional states, and physiological conditions. A deep
learning model based on ResNet50 architecture achieved 97% accuracy in
classifying human emotional states through plant voltage spectrograms, while
control models with shuffled labels achieved only 30% accuracy. This study
synthesizes findings from multiple experiments spanning 2020-2025, including
individual recognition (66% accuracy), eurythmic gesture detection, stress
prediction, and responses to human voice and movement. We propose that these
phenomena represent evolved anti-herbivory early warning systems, where plants
detect approaching animals through bioelectric field changes before physical
contact. Our results challenge conventional understanding of plant sensory
capabilities and suggest practical applications in agriculture, healthcare, and
human-plant interaction research.


### Biological Processes as Exploratory Dynamics
**Authors**: Jane Kondev, Marc Kirschner, Hernan G. Garcia, Gabriel L. Salmon, Rob Phillips

**Abstract**: Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying
dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive
trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process,
purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in
which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome
segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized
by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and
shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological
processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather
the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and
necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind
of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and
chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we
examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random
trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of
these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by
reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context
of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then
stacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit
exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative
examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for
exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series
of repeated trials that ultimately end in a "winning" trajectory. We also
explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter
exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such
processes.


### Computational Physics in the Advanced Lab: Experiment and Simulation of Thermal Diffusion in Metal Rods
**Authors**: Yash Mohod, Matthew C. Sullivan

**Published Date**: 2025-04-23

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-04

**PDF Url**: [2504.17108v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17108v2)

**Abstract**: We present a simple experiment on thermal diffusion in metal rods that can be
used to integrate computation into the advanced lab. An analytical solution
exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta
function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for
long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and
thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature of the metal rod due to
transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation
and the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with
the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the
experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent
agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. This
experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations
of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.


### Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories

**Abstract**: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit
hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from
the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such
solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated
in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist,
the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate
precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic
higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is
given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant
kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under
which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR
solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of
theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and
spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear
odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly,
we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any
deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in
particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de
Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the
stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation
of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in
this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.

**Abstract**: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging,
especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this
paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that
grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our
method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion
model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds
through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image
segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em
object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism
functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated
audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between
objects and their associated sounds. Project page:

### A Diffusion-Driven Temporal Super-Resolution and Spatial Consistency Enhancement Framework for 4D MRI imaging
**Authors**: Xuanru Zhou, Jiarun Liu, Shoujun Yu, Hao Yang, Cheng Li, Tao Tan, Shanshan Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-06-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-04

**PDF Url**: [2506.04116v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04116v1)

**Abstract**: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the
trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time
that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude
motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based
interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle
with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and
diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving
spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our
diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames
using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal
super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel
tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual
information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from
cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting
cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC
cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results
demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from
fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.


### Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion-Based Priors: An Approximation-Free Ensemble Sampling Approach
**Authors**: Haoxuan Chen, Yinuo Ren, Martin Renqiang Min, Lexing Ying, Zachary Izzo

**Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling
high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for
representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However,
current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs
rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the
generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we
propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without
the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing
works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process
encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding
posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a
reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle
methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior
distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained
score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we
validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our
method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based
methods.


### DiffCAP: Diffusion-based Cumulative Adversarial Purification for Vision Language Models

**Abstract**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a
significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite
often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter
model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper
introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can
effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding
minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its
latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP
cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input
data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy
images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach
to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion
model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean
representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive
experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths
in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing
defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly
reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time,
thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical
and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for
securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.


### VCT: Training Consistency Models with Variational Noise Coupling

**Abstract**: Consistency Training (CT) has recently emerged as a strong alternative to
diffusion models for image generation. However, non-distillation CT often
suffers from high variance and instability, motivating ongoing research into
its training dynamics. We propose Variational Consistency Training (VCT), a
flexible and effective framework compatible with various forward kernels,
including those in flow matching. Its key innovation is a learned noise-data
coupling scheme inspired by Variational Autoencoders, where a data-dependent
encoder models noise emission. This enables VCT to adaptively learn
noise-todata pairings, reducing training variance relative to the fixed,
unsorted pairings in classical CT. Experiments on multiple image datasets
demonstrate significant improvements: our method surpasses baselines, achieves
state-of-the-art FID among non-distillation CT approaches on CIFAR-10, and
matches SoTA performance on ImageNet 64 x 64 with only two sampling steps. Code
is available at https://github.com/sony/vct.
