**Abstract**: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that
captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals
observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential.
By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its
isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped
condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained
description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium
configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply
the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the
effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs
constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction
and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the
effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko
mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order
actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.

**Abstract**: Description of evolution between spatial slices in a general spacetime
suffers from a significant difficulty: the states on the slices, in a given
basis, are not related by a unitary transformation. This problem, which occurs
in spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number
of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular
will arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect
different facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is
directly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\"odinger picture
of evolution, and of evolution via "many-fingered time." One requires a
condition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general
this equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it
is determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard
condition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which
also may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the
state in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the
non-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of
these approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution. The issues
are extended in the context of quantum dynamical geometry, and raise important
questions for the proper description of the wavefunction of the universe and
for the role of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

**Abstract**: Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large
barriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical
systems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry
breaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for
certain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a
rigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models
with local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs.
To this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the
mathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check
(LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees
extensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional
assumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the
low-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an
asymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the
landscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of
the total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states --
which we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and
treats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those
with short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our
results apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p,
and while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family
of codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random
regular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both
models undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to
the onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.


### Advancing Seasonal Prediction of Tropical Cyclone Activity with a Hybrid AI-Physics Climate Model

**Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have
shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate
predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using Neural
General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model
developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric
variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by
physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface
temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist
anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can
generate 100 simulation days in ~8 minutes with a single Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU), while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC
climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions
(July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics.
Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East
Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7),
suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite
challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings,
the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations
with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p<0.1) and basin-wide
accumulated cyclone energy (p<0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific
basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with
physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate
predictions.

**Abstract**: Data collected using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique
(GITT) and application of the Sand equation is a ubiquitous method for
inferring the solid-state diffusivity in lithium-ion battery active materials.
However, the experiment is notoriously time-consuming and the Sand equation
relies on assumptions whose applicability can be questionable. We propose a
novel methodology, termed Inference from a Consistent Model (ICM), which
enables inference of solid-state diffusivity using the same physical model
employed for prediction, and is applicable to more general and quick-to-measure
data. We infer the diffusivity (as a function of inserted lithium
concentration) by minimising the residual sum of squares between data and
solutions to a spherically-symmetric nonlinear diffusion model in a single
representative active material particle. Using data harvested from the NMC
cathode of a commercial LG M50 cell we demonstrate that the ICM is robust, and
yields more accurate diffusivity estimates, while relying on data that are five
times faster to collect than that required by the classical approach. Moreover,
there is good reason to believe that further speed ups could be achieved when
other types of data are available. This work contributes towards developing
faster and more reliable techniques in parameter inference for lithium-ion
batteries, and the code required to deploy ICM is provided to facilitate its
adoption in future research.


### Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping

**PDF Url**: [2507.13268v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13268v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem
(which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and
statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite
squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang
tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows
to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet
(together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of
good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given
alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet can
tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully
with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings,
aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither
periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient
is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from
alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to
undecidable behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic
regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.

**Abstract**: High fidelity state transfer is an important ingredient of distributed
quantum information processing. We present and analyse results on perfect and
quasi-perfect state transfer with linear spin chains incorporating non-uniform
on-site energies. The motivation is maintenance of coupling uniformity, which
could be beneficial for some physical implementations. We relate this coupling
uniformity to a particle in a discrete potential analogue. Our analysis further
considers the statistical variation in couplings and on-site energies, as a
function of increasing chain site number N.

**Abstract**: Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, and
many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper
presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying
high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts
across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation,
industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems
such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture,
building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental
monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical
robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception,
control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central
goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by
highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and
climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and
domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation
to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate
priorities.


### Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$Λ$CDM parameter with cosmological data
**Authors**: Oliver H. E. Philcox, Eva Silverstein, Gonzalo Torroba

**PDF Url**: [2507.00115v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00115v2)

**Abstract**: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike
boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary
layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of
quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an
additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter
and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed
comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the
Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for
scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times
($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such
as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters,
the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history,
back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO
data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight
preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data
(including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits
into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve
this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by
topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on
additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in
the universe.


### Resources for bosonic metrology: quantum-enhanced precision from a superselection rule perspective

**Abstract**: Quantum optics and atomic systems are prominent platforms for exploiting
quantum-enhanced precision in parameter estimation. However, not only are
quantum optical and atomic systems often treated separately, but even within
quantum optics, identifying optimal probes (quantum states) and evolutions
(parameter-dependent dynamics) typically relies on case-by-case analyses. Mode,
and sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of
precision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection
between these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified
framework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing
regimes using bosonic resources. We introduce a superselection rule compliant
representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly incorporates the
phase reference, enforcing total particle number conservation. This approach
provides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally
equivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it
encompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics.
Within this framework, we consistently recover established results while
offering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources
responsible for precision enhancement. Moreover, we develop general strategies
to optimize precision using arbitrary multimode entangled probe states.
Finally, our formalism readily accommodates noise, measurement strategies and
non-unitary evolutions, extending its applicability to realistic experimental
scenarios.


## Diffusion
### Generative Diffusion Models for Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks

**PDF Url**: [2504.20277v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20277v2)

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic
resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We
formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility
function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples
from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the
constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert
and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal
performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To
enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize
the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture.
We present numerical results in a case study of power control.


### VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy
**Authors**: Dechen Gao, Boqi Zhao, Andrew Lee, Ian Chuang, Hanchu Zhou, Hang Wang, Zhe Zhao, Junshan Zhang, Iman Soltani

**Published Date**: 2025-07-17

**PDF Url**: [2507.13231v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13231v1)

**Abstract**: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

**Abstract**: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.


### Uni-Instruct: One-step Diffusion Model through Unified Diffusion Divergence Instruction
**Authors**: Yifei Wang, Weimin Bai, Colin Zhang, Debing Zhang, Weijian Luo, He Sun

**Published Date**: 2025-05-27

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-17

**PDF Url**: [2505.20755v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20755v2)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.
