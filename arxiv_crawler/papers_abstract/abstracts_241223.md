**Abstract**: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its
extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus
on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine
combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey
data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we
derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results
show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu < 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to
$\Sigma m_\nu < 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on
$\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the
separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and
its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma
m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a
$1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO),
with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong
constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at
$1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the
shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu > 0$, is only
present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra
relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the
Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV
partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is
included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.

**Abstract**: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS
turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc
postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address
the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes
non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for
realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework
for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and
conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding
equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to
enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the
conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model
architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills,
and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is
demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions
made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether,
the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant
anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.
We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as
part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear
mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising
results for the flat plate case.

**Authors**: Leon Schindler, Kristin Miriam de Payrebrune

**Abstract**: The design of soft robots is still commonly driven by manual trial-and-error
approaches, requiring the manufacturing of multiple physical prototypes, which
in the end, is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. To reduce the
number of manual interventions in this process, topology optimization can be
used to assist the design process. The design is then guided by simulations and
numerous prototypes can be tested in simulation rather than being evaluated
through laborious experiments. To implement this simulation-driven design
process, the possible design space of a slender soft pneumatic actuator is
generalized to the design of the circular cross-section. We perform a black-box
topology optimization using genetic algorithms to obtain a cross-sectional
design of a soft pneumatic actuator that is capable of reaching a target
workspace defined by the end-effector positions at different pressure values.
This design method is evaluated for three different case studies and target
workspaces, which were either randomly generated or specified by the operator
of the design assistant. The black-box topology optimization based on genetic
algorithms proves to be capable of finding good designs under given plausible
target workspaces. We considered a simplified simulation model to verify the
efficacy of the employed method. An experimental validation has not yet been
performed. It can be concluded that the employed black-box topology
optimization can assist in the design process for slender soft pneumatic
actuators. It supports at searching for possible design prototypes that reach
points specified by corresponding actuation pressures. This helps reduce the
trial-and-error driven iterative manual design process and enables the operator
to focus on prototypes that already offer a good viable solution.

**Authors**: Péter Pósfay, Marcell T. Kurbucz, Péter Kovács, Antal Jakovác

**Published Date**: 2023-07-04

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-20

**PDF Url**: [2307.01930v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01930v2)

**Abstract**: This paper introduces LLT-ECG, a novel method for electrocardiogram (ECG)
signal classification that leverages concepts from theoretical physics to
automatically generate features from time series data. Unlike traditional deep
learning approaches, LLT-ECG operates in a forward manner, eliminating the need
for backpropagation and hyperparameter tuning. By identifying linear laws that
capture shared patterns within specific classes, the proposed method constructs
a compact and verifiable representation, enhancing the effectiveness of
downstream classifiers. We demonstrate LLT-ECG's state-of-the-art performance
on real-world ECG datasets from PhysioNet, underscoring its potential for
medical applications where speed and verifiability are crucial.

**Authors**: Avisha Kumar, Xuzhe Zhi, Zan Ahmad, Minglang Yin, Amir Manbachi

**Published Date**: 2024-12-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-20

**PDF Url**: [2412.16118v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16118v1)

**Abstract**: Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a promising tool for optimally targeted
treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI), offering submillimeter precision to
enhance blood flow at injury sites while minimizing impact on surrounding
tissues. However, its efficacy is highly sensitive to the placement of the
ultrasound source, as the spinal cord's complex geometry and acoustic
heterogeneity distort and attenuate the FUS signal. Current approaches rely on
computer simulations to solve the governing wave propagation equations and
compute patient-specific pressure maps using ultrasound images of the spinal
cord anatomy. While accurate, these high-fidelity simulations are
computationally intensive, taking up to hours to complete parameter sweeps,
which is impractical for real-time surgical decision-making. To address this
bottleneck, we propose a convolutional deep operator network (DeepONet) to
rapidly predict FUS pressure fields in patient spinal cords. Unlike
conventional neural networks, DeepONets are well equipped to approximate the
solution operator of the parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that
govern the behavior of FUS waves with varying initial and boundary conditions
(i.e., new transducer locations or spinal cord geometries) without requiring
extensive simulations. Trained on simulated pressure maps across diverse
patient anatomies, this surrogate model achieves real-time predictions with
only a 2% loss on the test set, significantly accelerating the modeling of
nonlinear physical systems in heterogeneous domains. By facilitating rapid
parameter sweeps in surgical settings, this work provides a crucial step toward
precise and individualized solutions in neurosurgical treatments.


### Explainable AI for Multivariate Time Series Pattern Exploration: Latent Space Visual Analytics with Time Fusion Transformer and Variational Autoencoders in Power Grid Event Diagnosis
**Authors**: Haowen Xu, Ali Boyaci, Jianming Lian, Aaron Wilson

**Published Date**: 2024-12-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-20

**PDF Url**: [2412.16098v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16098v1)

**Abstract**: Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is
crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations.
However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity,
and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding
of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face
limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability,
reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a
novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Time
Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex
patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using
dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN.
These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and
tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal
patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential
correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is
demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it
identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies
with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are
introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and
consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different
configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter
tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT
achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data
shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time
series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.


### Robust gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions
**Authors**: Jakob Schluck, Ella Nikodem, Anton Montag, Alexander Ziesen, Mahasweta Bagchi, Fabian Hassler, Yoichi Ando

**PDF Url**: [2406.08265v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08265v2)

**Abstract**: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect
is used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface
state (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction
made on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the
existence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev
modes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a
function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction.
Here, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\varphi =
(2n+1)\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of
states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux
loop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials,
supporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field,
Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the
gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi =
(2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of
spin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the
observed gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-20

**PDF Url**: [2412.16076v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16076v1)

**Abstract**: In the Standard Model (SM), electroweak (EW) corrections become significant
at high energies, particularly at the tera-electronvolt scale and beyond, due
to the presence of Sudakov logarithms. At these energy scales, the Standard
Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework provides an enhanced sensitivity
to potential new physics effects. This motivates the inclusion of EW
corrections not only for SM predictions but also for analyses within SMEFT. In
this work, we compute EW corrections in the high-energy limit for a selected
set of dimension-six operators, specifically the class of four-fermion contact
interactions, in key hard-scattering processes relevant to both current and
future colliders: top-quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
and in a muon collider scenario, as well as the Drell-Yan process at the LHC.
We first discuss the technical details and challenges associated with
evaluating EW Sudakov logarithms in SMEFT, contrasting them with the SM case.
We then present phenomenological results for the aforementioned processes,
highlighting the non-trivial effects introduced by EW corrections arising from
the insertion of dimension-six, four-fermion operators. Importantly, the
resulting $K$-factors exhibit significant deviations from their SM
counterparts, with dependencies not only on the process but also on the
specific operators considered. Finally, we explore the potential to lift flat
directions in the SMEFT parameter space by incorporating higher-order
corrections, using Fisher information techniques.

Borschevsky, A. Brinson, K. Chrysalidis, T. E. Cocolios, R. P. de Groote, A. Dorne, C. M. Fajardo-Zambrano, R. W. Field, K. T. Flanagan, S. Franchoo, R. F. Garcia Ruiz, K. Gaul, S. Geldhof, T. F. Giesen, D. Hanstorp, R. Heinke, P. Imgram, T. A. Isaev, A. A. Kyuberis, S. Kujanpää, L. Lalanne, P. Lassègues, J. Lim, Y. C. Liu, K. M. Lynch, A. McGlone, W. C. Mei, G. Neyens, M. Nichols, L.

**Abstract**: We report the spectroscopy of the 14 lowest excited electronic states in the
radioactive molecule radium monofluoride (RaF). The observed excitation
energies are compared with fully relativistic state-of-the-art Fock-space
coupled cluster (FS-RCC) calculations, which achieve an agreement of >=99.64%
(within ~12 meV) with experiment for all states. Guided by theory, a firm
assignment of the angular momentum and term symbol is made for 10 states and a
tentative assignment for 4 states. The role of high-order electron correlation
and quantum electrodynamics effects in the excitation energy of excited states
is studied, found to be important for all states. Establishing the simultaneous
accuracy and precision of calculations is an important step for research at the
intersection of particle, nuclear, and chemical physics, including searches of
physics beyond the Standard Model, for which RaF is a promising probe.

**PDF Url**: [2412.00703v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00703v3)

**Abstract**: A Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) is a collection of thunderstorms that
function as a system, representing a widely discussed phenomenon in both the
natural sciences and visual effects industries, and embodying the untamed
forces of nature.In this paper, we present the first interactive, physically
inspired mesoscale thunderstorms simulation model that integrates
Grabowski-style cloud microphysics with atmospheric electrification processes.
Our model simulates thunderclouds development and lightning flashes within a
unified meteorological framework, providing a realistic and interactive
approach for graphical applications. By incorporating key physical principles,
it effectively links cloud formation, electrification, and lightning
generation. The simulation also encompasses various thunderstorm types and
their corresponding lightning activities.

**Abstract**: Modern vision models excel at general purpose downstream tasks. It is
unclear, however, how they may be used for personalized vision tasks, which are
both fine-grained and data-scarce. Recent works have successfully applied
synthetic data to general-purpose representation learning, while advances in
T2I diffusion models have enabled the generation of personalized images from
just a few real examples. Here, we explore a potential connection between these
ideas, and formalize the challenge of using personalized synthetic data to
learn personalized representations, which encode knowledge about an object of
interest and may be flexibly applied to any downstream task relating to the
target object. We introduce an evaluation suite for this challenge, including
reformulations of two existing datasets and a novel dataset explicitly
constructed for this purpose, and propose a contrastive learning approach that
makes creative use of image generators. We show that our method improves
personalized representation learning for diverse downstream tasks, from
recognition to segmentation, and analyze characteristics of image generation
approaches that are key to this gain.


### Synthesizing Moving People with 3D Control

**PDF Url**: [2401.10889v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10889v2)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a diffusion model-based framework for animating
people from a single image for a given target 3D motion sequence. Our approach
has two core components: a) learning priors about invisible parts of the human
body and clothing, and b) rendering novel body poses with proper clothing and
texture. For the first part, we learn an in-filling diffusion model to
hallucinate unseen parts of a person given a single image. We train this model
on texture map space, which makes it more sample-efficient since it is
invariant to pose and viewpoint. Second, we develop a diffusion-based rendering
pipeline, which is controlled by 3D human poses. This produces realistic
renderings of novel poses of the person, including clothing, hair, and
plausible in-filling of unseen regions. This disentangled approach allows our
method to generate a sequence of images that are faithful to the target motion
in the 3D pose and, to the input image in terms of visual similarity. In
addition to that, the 3D control allows various synthetic camera trajectories
to render a person. Our experiments show that our method is resilient in
generating prolonged motions and varied challenging and complex poses compared
to prior methods. Please check our website for more details:

**PDF Url**: [2412.16083v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16083v1)

**Abstract**: The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in finance
necessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold
privacy standards. We introduce DP-Fed-FinDiff framework, a novel integration
of Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data.
This framework ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations while
maintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-Fed-FinDiff on
multiple real-world financial datasets, achieving significant improvements in
privacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations
reveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations,
and federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of
DP-Fed-FinDiff to enable secure data sharing and robust analytics in highly
regulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning
and privacy-preserving data synthesis.


### Label-Efficient Data Augmentation with Video Diffusion Models for Guidewire Segmentation in Cardiac Fluoroscopy
**Authors**: Shaoyan Pan, Yikang Liu, Lin Zhao, Eric Z. Chen, Xiao Chen, Terrence Chen, Shanhui Sun

**PDF Url**: [2412.16050v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16050v1)

**Abstract**: The accurate segmentation of guidewires in interventional cardiac fluoroscopy
videos is crucial for computer-aided navigation tasks. Although deep learning
methods have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in wire segmentation,
they require substantial annotated datasets for generalizability, underscoring
the need for extensive labeled data to enhance model performance. To address
this challenge, we propose the Segmentation-guided Frame-consistency Video
Diffusion Model (SF-VD) to generate large collections of labeled fluoroscopy
videos, augmenting the training data for wire segmentation networks. SF-VD
leverages videos with limited annotations by independently modeling scene
distribution and motion distribution. It first samples the scene distribution
by generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a
specified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively
generating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a
frame-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the
process by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in
the synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the
superior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in
guidewire segmentation.

**Abstract**: Phase imaging is gaining importance due to its applications in fields like
biomedical imaging and material characterization. In biomedical applications,
it can provide quantitative information missing in label-free microscopy
modalities. One of the most prominent methods in phase quantification is the
Transport-of-Intensity Equation (TIE). TIE often requires multiple acquisitions
at different defocus distances, which is not always feasible in a clinical
setting. To address this issue, we propose to use chromatic aberrations to
induce the required through-focus images with a single exposure, effectively
generating a through-focus stack. Since the defocus distance induced by the
aberrations is small, conventional TIE solvers are insufficient to address the
resulting artifacts. We propose Zero-Mean Diffusion, a modified version of
diffusion models designed for quantitative image prediction, and train it with
synthetic data to ensure robust phase retrieval. Our contributions offer an
alternative TIE approach that leverages chromatic aberrations, achieving
accurate single-exposure phase measurement with white light and thus improving
the efficiency of phase imaging. Moreover, we present a new class of diffusion
models that are well-suited for quantitative data and have a sound theoretical
basis. To validate our approach, we employ a widespread brightfield microscope
equipped with a commercially available color camera. We apply our model to
clinical microscopy of patients' urine, obtaining accurate phase measurements.


## Quantitative Finance
### Correct implied volatility shapes and reliable pricing in the rough Heston model
**Authors**: Svetlana Boyarchenko, Sergei Levendorskiǐ

**Published Date**: 2024-12-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-20

**PDF Url**: [2412.16067v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16067v1)

**Abstract**: We use modifications of the Adams method and very fast and accurate
sinh-acceleration method of the Fourier inversion (iFT) (S.Boyarchenko and
Levendorski\u{i}, IJTAF 2019, v.22) to evaluate prices of vanilla options; for
options of moderate and long maturities and strikes not very far from the spot,
thousands of prices can be calculated in several msec. with relative errors of
the order of 0.5\% and smaller running Matlab on a Mac with moderate
characteristics. We demonstrate that for the calibrated set of parameters in
Euch and Rosenbaum, Math. Finance 2019, v. 29, the correct implied volatility
surface is significantly flatter and fits the data very poorly, hence, the
calibration results in op.cit. is an example of the {\em ghost calibration}
(M.Boyarchenko and Levendorki\u{i}, Quantitative Finance 2015, v. 15): the
errors of the model and numerical method almost cancel one another. We explain
how calibration errors of this sort are generated by each of popular versions
of numerical realizations of iFT (Carr-Madan, Lipton-Lewis and COS methods)
with prefixed parameters of a numerical method, resulting in spurious
volatility smiles and skews. We suggest a general {\em Conformal Bootstrap
principle} which allows one to avoid ghost calibration errors. We outline
schemes of application of Conformal Bootstrap principle and the method of the
paper to the design of accurate and fast calibration procedures.
