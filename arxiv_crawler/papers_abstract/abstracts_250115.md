**Abstract**: The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band
waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton
gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency),
with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower
frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has
been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A
theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been
presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence
of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field,
such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel
electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to
conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe
passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant
wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric
fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron
heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence
of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed
mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.

**Abstract**: Manipulation of viscous liquids is an essential kitchen activity - from
pouring golden syrup onto a pancake to decorating a cake with whipped cream
frosting, from streaming ketchup on top of French fries to dispensing molten
chocolate onto a strawberry. Typical viscosities in these and many other
kitchen flows, and the heights from which the streams are dispensed, make such
jets susceptible to the coiling instability. Indeed, the coiling of a thin
thread of poured maple syrup is a source of fascination for children and adults
alike, whereas the folding of the stream of ketchup squeezed out from a plastic
bottle is a phenomenon familiar to all. In this paper, we review the fluid
dynamics of such kitchen flows and discuss separately the case when the
substrate is stationary (honey on a toast), and when it translates (cookies on
a conveyor belt) or rotates (a pancake on a spinning hot plate). It is hoped
that this may encourage experimentation and enjoyment of physics in the
kitchen, and perhaps even lead to more elegant if not more tasty culinary
results.

**Abstract**: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective
when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring
this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information system
data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy.
Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict
coverage and minimize interference in wireless deployments. Machine
learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with
feature-based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable
propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set
of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly,
maintaining model generalization across a broad range of environments.

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-14

**PDF Url**: [2411.12414v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12414v2)

**Abstract**: An analysis methodology is developed for the time-of-flight (TOF) signals
recorded by two or more collinear neutron detectors located at different
distances from a pulsed neutron source. It is based on taking central moments
of the TOF signals and relating these to a set of co-moments of the
distribution of production times and velocities of neutrons emitted towards the
detectors. Given n detectors, we can obtain all such co-moments of order n-1
and lower. Co-moments contain information on the time-varying behaviour of the
neutron source. A physical interpretation is provided for several co-moments of
interest.

**Abstract**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for
domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have
developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of
polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our
optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and
cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological
domains.


### On the first test of the Weak Equivalence Principle in low Earth orbit
**Authors**: Anna M. Nobili, Alberto Anselmi

**PDF Url**: [2302.06400v6](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06400v6)

**Abstract**: The Weak Equivalence Principle is the founding pillar of General Relativity
and as such it should be verified as precisely as possible. The Microscope
experiment tested it in low Earth orbit, finding that Pt and Ti test masses
fall toward Earth with the same acceleration to about 1e-15, an improvement of
about two orders of magnitude over ground tests. Space missions, even if small,
are expensive and hard to replicate; yet, the essence of physics is
repeatability. This work is an assessment of the Microscope results based on
the laws of physics and knowledge from previous experiments, focusing on the
limiting thermal noise and the treatment of acceleration outliers. Thermal
noise reveals anomalies that we explain by stray sub-microVolt potentials
caused by patch charges, giving rise to an unstable zero. The measurements were
affected by numerous acceleration spikes occurring at the synodic frequencies
relative to the Earth (the signal frequency) and the Sun, which we interpret as
evidence of a thermal origin. In Microscope authors' analysis, the spikes were
removed and the resulting gaps replaced with artificial data (up to 35, 40 per
cent of the sessions data), which retain memory of the gaps and may simulate or
cancel an effect (signal or systematic). An alternative approach based
exclusively on real measured data would avoid any ambiguity. The lessons of
Microscope are crucial to any futures improved mission.

**PDF Url**: [2501.08278v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08278v1)

**Abstract**: We propose two medium-baseline, kiloton-scale neutrino experiments to study
neutrinos from LHC proton-proton collisions: SINE, a surface-based scintillator
panel detector observing muon neutrinos from the CMS interaction point, and
UNDINE, a water Cherenkov detector submerged in lake Geneva observing
all-flavor neutrinos from LHCb. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate
millions of neutrino interactions during the high-luminosity LHC era. We show
that these datasets can constrain neutrino cross sections, charm production in
$pp$ collisions, and strangeness enhancement as a solution to the cosmic-ray
muon puzzle. SINE and UNDINE thus offer a cost-effective medium-baseline
complement to the proposed short-baseline forward physics facility.

**Abstract**: Type-II Dirac points (DPs), which occur at the intersection of strongly
tilted and touching energy bands, exhibit many intriguing physical phenomena
fundamentally different from the non-tilted type-I counterparts. Over the past
decade, their discovery has spurred extensive research into electronic systems
and other Bloch-wave systems, such as photonic and phononic crystals. However,
current studies typically focus on type-II DPs along high-symmetry directions
in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) under mirror symmetry conditions, which are
highly restrictive and limit further investigations and applications. To
overcome the stringent constraint, here we identify and demonstrate the
emergence of type-II DPs at general positions inside the FBZ without requiring
the mirror symmetry. The type-II DPs, being accidental degeneracies, are
experimentally realized on a metacrystal slab with H-shaped metallic patterns.
Our findings indicate that even in the absence of mirror symmetry, type-II DPs
can emerge at designated locations inside the FBZ by simply rotating the
H-shaped patterns and adjusting geometrical and physical parameters.
Furthermore, based on the rotated type-II DPs, off-axis conical diffractions
have been both realized and experimentally observed. Meanwhile, we discovered
that during the rotation process, the type-II DPs transform into off-axis
type-I DPs, but still strongly tilted, resulting in the emergence of negative
refractions. Hence, the generic method we propose for inducing type-II or
strongly tilted type-I DPs without the high-symmetry limitations opens
potential avenues for related research. For example, the observed off-axis
conical diffraction and negative refraction could inspire future development
and applications in photonics and other Bloch-wave systems.


### Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width
**Authors**: Stuart Yi-Thomas, Yi Huang, Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma

**Published Date**: 2025-01-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-14

**PDF Url**: [2501.08273v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08273v1)

**Abstract**: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer
quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary
analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple,
physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or
temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or
decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the
longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the
longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there
"floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can
disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is
the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides
answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We
discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest
future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and
temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an
intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE
plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be
considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.


### Fluctuating Ensemble Averages and the BTZ Threshold

**Abstract**: Recent work shows fascinating links between ensemble averaging and the
Swampland program. In order to break the emerging global symmetries of the
ensemble averaging as dictated by the no global symmetries conjecture, one may
consider fluctuations away from the average given by deviations in the
Siegel-Weil formula. In this work, we investigate the physical interpretation
of these fluctuations in the bulk physics and pinpoint the states giving rise
to them. For this purpose, we explore an ensemble of generalised Narain CFTs
and build the AdS$_{3}$ gravitational dual in the Chern-Simons (CS) framework.
We study the associated charged BTZ black hole solution and assess its
stability. Using the Swampland weak gravity conjecture, we show that the
fluctuations of the ensemble average are below the BTZ threshold and correspond
to a sublattice of superextremal states emitted by the black hole. We exploit
the logarithmic density of states to derive bounds on the charged vectors of
the abelian CS symmetry and introduce a novel formulation of the density
function to ensure consistency with the sublattice WGC. We establish bounds
that allows to distinguish heavy states contributing to the average from light
states generating fluctuations around it.


## Diffusion
### Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation
**Authors**: Shanchuan Lin, Xin Xia, Yuxi Ren, Ceyuan Yang, Xuefeng Xiao, Lu Jiang

**Published Date**: 2025-01-14

**PDF Url**: [2501.08316v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08316v1)

**Abstract**: The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but
their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing
distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation
in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In
this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data
following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the
training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model
architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1
regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our
adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720,
24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally,
our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving
quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.


### FDPP: Fine-tune Diffusion Policy with Human Preference

**Abstract**: Imitation learning from human demonstrations enables robots to perform
complex manipulation tasks and has recently witnessed huge success. However,
these techniques often struggle to adapt behavior to new preferences or changes
in the environment. To address these limitations, we propose Fine-tuning
Diffusion Policy with Human Preference (FDPP). FDPP learns a reward function
through preference-based learning. This reward is then used to fine-tune the
pre-trained policy with reinforcement learning (RL), resulting in alignment of
pre-trained policy with new human preferences while still solving the original
task. Our experiments across various robotic tasks and preferences demonstrate
that FDPP effectively customizes policy behavior without compromising
performance. Additionally, we show that incorporating Kullback-Leibler (KL)
regularization during fine-tuning prevents over-fitting and helps maintain the
competencies of the initial policy.


### Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Junyu Chen, Han Cai, Junsong Chen, Enze Xie, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Muyang Li, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2410.10733v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10733v4)

**Abstract**: We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder
models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder
models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression
ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for
high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by
introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our
models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to
alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;
(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases
training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high
spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the
autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the
reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we
achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet
512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup
on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely
used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder. Our code is available at

### Text-Diffusion Red-Teaming of Large Language Models: Unveiling Harmful Behaviors with Proximity Constraints
**Authors**: Jonathan Nöther, Adish Singla, Goran Radanović

**Abstract**: Recent work has proposed automated red-teaming methods for testing the
vulnerabilities of a given target large language model (LLM). These methods use
red-teaming LLMs to uncover inputs that induce harmful behavior in a target
LLM. In this paper, we study red-teaming strategies that enable a targeted
security assessment. We propose an optimization framework for red-teaming with
proximity constraints, where the discovered prompts must be similar to
reference prompts from a given dataset. This dataset serves as a template for
the discovered prompts, anchoring the search for test-cases to specific topics,
writing styles, or types of harmful behavior. We show that established
auto-regressive model architectures do not perform well in this setting. We
therefore introduce a black-box red-teaming method inspired by text-diffusion
models: Diffusion for Auditing and Red-Teaming (DART). DART modifies the
reference prompt by perturbing it in the embedding space, directly controlling
the amount of change introduced. We systematically evaluate our method by
comparing its effectiveness with established methods based on model fine-tuning
and zero- and few-shot prompting. Our results show that DART is significantly
more effective at discovering harmful inputs in close proximity to the
reference prompt.


### D$^2$-DPM: Dual Denoising for Quantized Diffusion Probabilistic Models
**Authors**: Qian Zeng, Jie Song, Han Zheng, Hao Jiang, Mingli Song

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-14

**PDF Url**: [2501.08180v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08180v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have achieved cutting-edge performance in image generation.
However, their lengthy denoising process and computationally intensive score
estimation network impede their scalability in low-latency and
resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses and
accelerates diffusion models without retraining, but it inevitably introduces
additional quantization noise, resulting in mean and variance deviations. In
this work, we propose D2-DPM, a dual denoising mechanism aimed at precisely
mitigating the adverse effects of quantization noise on the noise estimation
network. Specifically, we first unravel the impact of quantization noise on the
sampling equation into two components: the mean deviation and the variance
deviation. The mean deviation alters the drift coefficient of the sampling
equation, influencing the trajectory trend, while the variance deviation
magnifies the diffusion coefficient, impacting the convergence of the sampling
trajectory. The proposed D2-DPM is thus devised to denoise the quantization
noise at each time step, and then denoise the noisy sample through the inverse
diffusion iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that D2-DPM achieves
superior generation quality, yielding a 1.42 lower FID than the full-precision
model while achieving 3.99x compression and 11.67x bit-operation acceleration.
