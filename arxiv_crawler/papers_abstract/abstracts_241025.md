**Abstract**: The use of non-invasive sensors & systems to measure particle beam
characteristics is a crucial part of modern accelerator control systems due to
their ability to return real time passive measurements without impacting the
beam quality. Simulations, which can predict these sensors' behaviour and
performance under anticipated accelerator conditions, are valuable tools to
ensure confidence in the sensors' functionality prior to a physical bench test.
This paper details the design, testing, and results of two sensor models
developed using CST Studio Suite software. One model is an elliptical,
large-aperture beam position monitor (BPM) for which vertical & horizontal
position signal linearity was analyzed. The second model is an AC current
transformer (ACCT) beam current monitor (BCM), which was used to search for
potential fault cases within the BCM and beam pipe flange gaps. Fermilab Proton
Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) accelerator beam conditions were applied, and
special focus is given to the discovery of linearity variations within the BPM
as well as the use of frequency domain techniques in the BCM fault case
analyses.

**Abstract**: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are very useful in the description of
strongly correlated systems, partly because they allow encoding symmetries,
either global or local (gauge), naturally. In recent years, PEPS with local
symmetries have increasingly been used in the study of non-perturbative regimes
of lattice gauge theories, most prominently as a way to construct variational
ansatz states depending only on a small number of parameters and yet capturing
the relevant physical properties. For the case of one-dimensional PEPS (Matrix
Product States - MPS) a bidirectional connection was established between the
internal structure of the tensor network, i.e. the mathematical properties of
the constituent tensors, and the symmetry. In higher dimensions this has only
been done for global symmetries, where in the local (gauge) case it is known
only how to construct gauge-invariant states, but not what the symmetry implies
on the internal structure of the PEPS. In the present work we complete this
missing piece and study the internal structure of projected entangled pair
states with a gauge symmetry. The PEPS we consider consist of matter and gauge
field tensors placed on the vertices and edges, respectively, of arbitrary
graphs.

**Abstract**: In this work, we establish a generalized transfer matrix method that provides
exact analytical and numerical solutions for lattice versions of topological
models with surface termination in one direction. We construct a generalized
eigenvalue equation, equivalent to the conventional transfer matrix, which
neither suffers from nor requires singular (non-invertible) inter-layer hopping
matrices, in contrast to previous works. We then apply this formalism to
derive, with exactness, the topological surface states and Fermi arc states in
two prototypical topological models: the 3D Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model and a
lattice model exhibiting Weyl semimetal behavior. Our results show that the
surface states and bulk bands, across the projected 2D Brillouin zone, agree
perfectly with those obtained through direct numerical diagonalization of the
corresponding Hamiltonians in a slab geometry. This highlights that the
generalized transfer matrix method is not only a powerful tool but also a
highly efficient alternative to fully numerical methods for investigating
surface physics and interfaces in topological systems, particularly when it is
required to go beyond low-energy effective descriptions.

**Abstract**: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers employing two-equation eddy
viscosity models are the industry standard for simulating turbulent flows using
the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation. While these methods are
computationally less expensive than direct numerical simulations, they can
still incur significant computational costs to achieve the desired accuracy. In
this context, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising
approach for developing parametric surrogate models that leverage both
existing, but limited CFD solutions and the governing differential equations to
predict simulation outcomes in a computationally efficient, differentiable, and
near real-time manner. In this work, we build upon the previously proposed
RANS-PINN framework, which only focused on predicting flow over a cylinder. To
investigate the efficacy of RANS-PINN as a viable approach to building
parametric surrogate models, we investigate its accuracy in predicting relevant
turbulent flow variables for both internal and external flows. To ensure
training convergence with a more complex loss function, we adopt a novel
sampling approach that exploits the domain geometry to ensure a proper balance
among the contributions from various regions within the solution domain. The
effectiveness of this framework is then demonstrated for two scenarios that
represent a broad class of internal and external flow problems.

**Abstract**: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have
challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to
the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly
excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of
many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical
models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg
simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what
models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate
that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes
PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show
that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on
a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory
dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation
requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than
from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using
Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.


### Modulated Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators for Temporal Interpolation of Weather Forecasts
**Authors**: Jussi Leinonen, Boris Bonev, Thorsten Kurth, Yair Cohen

**Published Date**: 2024-10-24

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-24

**PDF Url**: [2410.18904v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18904v1)

**Abstract**: Weather and climate data are often available at limited temporal resolution,
either due to storage limitations, or in the case of weather forecast models
based on deep learning, their inherently long time steps. The coarse temporal
resolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. To
address this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructs
the atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known.
The model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourier
neural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather prediction
and other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulated
AFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolation
target time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operation
inside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can be
used to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between two
time steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 h
resolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishable
from the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSE
loss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared to
linear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce the
statistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves better
than 6 h resolution data. The ModAFNO layer is generic and is expected to be
applicable to other problems, including weather forecasting with tunable lead
time.


### Finite-Time Processes In Quantum Thermodynamics: The Limits Of Irreversibility

**Abstract**: The emergence of irreversibility in physical processes, despite the
fundamentally reversible nature of quantum mechanics, remains an open question
in physics. This thesis explores the intricate relationship between quantum
mechanics and thermodynamics, with a particular focus on minimizing entropy
production in finite-time processes. By employing tools from quantum
information theory and geometric thermodynamics, we tackle the challenge of
deriving irreversible thermodynamic behavior from the reversible microscopic
framework of quantum mechanics. We begin with a comprehensive review of the
laws of thermodynamics, setting the stage for the subsequent analyses. We
introduce novel developments in quantum thermodynamics through a generalized
framework for geometric thermodynamics, which enables the derivation of
finite-time corrections beyond the Markovian regime. Building on this
foundation, we extend Landauer's principle by incorporating a finite-time
correction that highlights the necessity of strong coupling for optimal
information erasure processes. This result underscores the emergence of
Planckian time as a fundamental speed limit to thermalization. Additionally, we
explore how collective effects can be harnessed to reduce energy dissipation in
thermodynamic operations, revealing that classical correlations between systems
can significantly mitigate dissipation, though this may pose new questions
regarding the third law of thermodynamics. Finally, we optimize thermodynamic
processes in mesoscopic systems, including quantum dot engines and information
engines. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the fundamental
limits of irreversibility but also open new avenues for research. Future works
will focus on fully exploiting collective effects, aligning these with the
third law of thermodynamics, and understanding the thermodynamic consistency of
master equations.

**Abstract**: Particle physics underpins our understanding of the world at a fundamental
level by describing the interplay of matter and forces through gauge theories.
Yet, despite their unmatched success, the intrinsic quantum mechanical nature
of gauge theories makes important problem classes notoriously difficult to
address with classical computational techniques. A promising way to overcome
these roadblocks is offered by quantum computers, which are based on the same
laws that make the classical computations so difficult. Here, we present a
quantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of
two-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields
and matter. This computation is made possible by the use of a trapped-ion qudit
quantum processor, where quantum information is encoded in $d$ different states
per ion, rather than in two states as in qubits. Qudits are ideally suited for
describing gauge fields, which are naturally high-dimensional, leading to a
dramatic reduction in the quantum register size and circuit complexity. Using a
variational quantum eigensolver, we find the ground state of the model and
observe the interplay between virtual pair creation and quantized magnetic
field effects. The qudit approach further allows us to seamlessly observe the
effect of different gauge field truncations by controlling the qudit dimension.
Our results open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations with
qudits in near-term quantum devices.


### Exactly solvable models for 2+1D topological phases derived from crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras
**Authors**: Vincent Koppen, João Faria Martins, Paul Purdon Martin

**Published Date**: 2021-04-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-24

**PDF Url**: [2104.02766v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02766v3)

**Abstract**: We define an exactly solvable model for 2+1D topological phases of matter on
a triangulated surface derived from a crossed module of semisimple
finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, the `Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model'.
This model generalizes both the Kitaev quantum double model for a semisimple
Hopf algebra and the full higher Kitaev model derived from a 2-group, and can
hence be interpreted as a Hopf-algebraic discrete higher gauge theory.
  We construct a family of crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras,
$(\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(X) \otimes \mathbb{C}E \xrightarrow{\partial}
\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(Y) \rtimes \mathbb{C} G, \triangleright)$, that
depends on four finite groups, $E,G,X$ and $Y$. We calculate the ground-state
spaces of the resulting model on a triangulated surface when $G=E=\{1\}$ and
when $Y=\{1\}$, prove that those ground-state spaces are canonically
independent of the triangulations, and so depend only on the underlying
surface; and moreover we find a 2+1D TQFT whose state spaces on surfaces give
the ground-state spaces. These TQFTs are particular cases of Quinn's finite
total homotopy TQFT and hence the state spaces assigned to surfaces are free
vector spaces on sets of homotopy classes of maps from a surface to homotopy
finite spaces, in this case obtained as classifying spaces of finite groupoids
and finite crossed modules of groupoids.
  We leave it as an open problem whether the ground-state space of the
Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model on a triangulated surface is independent of
the triangulation for general crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras,
whether a TQFT always exists whose state space on a surface gives the
ground-state space of the model, and whether the ground-state space of the
model obtained from $E,G,X,Y$ can always be given a homotopical explanation.

**PDF Url**: [2410.18886v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18886v1)

**Abstract**: This letter introduces a novel analytical approach to calculating phase-space
integrals, crucial for precision in particle physics. We develop a method to
compute angular components using multifold Mellin-Barnes integrals, yielding
results in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms for integrals involving three
denominators. Our results include expressions for massless momenta up to
$\cal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ and for one massive momentum up to $\cal{O}(\epsilon)$.
Additionally, we derive recursion relations that reduce integrals with higher
powers of denominators to simpler ones. We detail how to combine the angular
part with the radial one which requires a careful handling of singularities.


## Diffusion

**Abstract**: Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D
object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network
architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric
consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in
module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion
models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for
each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate
multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the
rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature
addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version
based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing
neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter
not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models
such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation
using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the
broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in
text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.


### On the Crucial Role of Initialization for Matrix Factorization
**Authors**: Bingcong Li, Liang Zhang, Aryan Mokhtari, Niao He

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-24

**PDF Url**: [2410.18965v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18965v1)

**Abstract**: This work revisits the classical low-rank matrix factorization problem and
unveils the critical role of initialization in shaping convergence rates for
such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We introduce Nystrom initialization,
which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent
(ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks.
Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achieves
quadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known.
Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly
used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with
Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various
downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language
and diffusion models.


### Stable Consistency Tuning: Understanding and Improving Consistency Models
**Authors**: Fu-Yun Wang, Zhengyang Geng, Hongsheng Li

**Published Date**: 2024-10-24

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-24

**PDF Url**: [2410.18958v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18958v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow
generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast,
consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance
with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through
consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or
consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising
process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing
consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal
Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze
the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon
Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT),
which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT
leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID
1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.


### Diff-Instruct++: Training One-step Text-to-image Generator Model to Align with Human Preferences
**Authors**: Weijian Luo

**Published Date**: 2024-10-24

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-24

**PDF Url**: [2410.18881v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18881v1)

**Abstract**: One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift
inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation
performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator
models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of
reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment
problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral
Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By
overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the
first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method
for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical
insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing
RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential
contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we
align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use
the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion
processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a
strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO
validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score
(HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable
Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical
contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong
human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models.

**Abstract**: The emergence of diffusion models has transformed synthetic media generation,
offering unmatched realism and control over content creation. These
advancements have driven innovation across fields such as art, design, and
scientific visualization. However, they also introduce significant ethical and
societal challenges, particularly through the creation of hyper-realistic
images that can facilitate deepfakes, misinformation, and unauthorized
reproduction of copyrighted material. In response, the need for effective
detection mechanisms has become increasingly urgent. This review examines the
evolving adversarial relationship between diffusion model development and the
advancement of detection methods. We present a thorough analysis of
contemporary detection strategies, including frequency and spatial domain
techniques, deep learning-based approaches, and hybrid models that combine
multiple methodologies. We also highlight the importance of diverse datasets
and standardized evaluation metrics in improving detection accuracy and
generalizability. Our discussion explores the practical applications of these
detection systems in copyright protection, misinformation prevention, and
forensic analysis, while also addressing the ethical implications of synthetic
media. Finally, we identify key research gaps and propose future directions to
enhance the robustness and adaptability of detection methods in line with the
rapid advancements of diffusion models. This review emphasizes the necessity of
a comprehensive approach to mitigating the risks associated with AI-generated
content in an increasingly digital world.
