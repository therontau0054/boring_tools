**Abstract**: The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury
Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation
of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental
processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into
already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of
light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm
f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.
Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a
quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak
interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have
a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)
beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can
completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive
ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly
tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of
magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme
sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light
scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic
gases.

**Abstract**: The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with
spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent
debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent
papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims
of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any
extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the
special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM
calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is
the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with
experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in
spatiotemporal light fields.

**Abstract**: Nonlinear electrodynamics has been an important area of research for a long
time. Investigations based on nonlinear Lagrangians, such as Euler-Heisenberg
and Born-Infeld, are instrumental in exploring the limits of classical and
quantum field theories, providing valuable insights into strong-field
phenomena. In this context, this work considers how light propagates in
strong-field environments, where such nonlinearities play significant roles,
offering a way to investigate events in high-energy astrophysics, quantum
optics, and fundamental physics beyond classical Maxwell's framework. Here,
several aspects of light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics are
discussed. Phase and group velocities are derived and several interesting
behaviors are unveiled, such as birefringence, non-reciprocal propagation, and
asymmetries between phase and group velocities in special configurations.
Specific solutions based on commonly studied nonlinear theories are also
investigated, and phenomena like slow-light and one-way propagation are
discussed.

**Abstract**: Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class
that combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the
versatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of
amorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline
polymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such
structural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or
computationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining
experimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic
potentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate
framework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear
differences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous
tetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption
that these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this
end, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous
solids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in
crystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into
the structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new
avenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more
generally.

**Abstract**: Precision studies of flavour-changing processes involving quarks and leptons
provide a number of ways to improve knowledge of the Standard Model and search
for physics beyond it. There are excellent short- and mid-term prospects for
significantly improved measurements in heavy flavour physics (involving b and c
hadrons and $\tau$ leptons), with upgrades in progress or planned for the
ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments exploiting proton-proton collisions at CERN's
Large Hadron Collider, and for the Belle II experiment operating with
electron-positron collisions from the SuperKEKB accelerator in KEK. The
expected sensitivities that can be achieved from these experiments for a number
of key observables are presented, highlighting the complementarity of the
different experiments and showing how the precision will improve with time.
This international programme in heavy flavour physics will result in
unprecedented capability to probe this sector of the Standard Model and,
potentially, observe imprints of physics at higher energy scales than can be
accessed directly.

**Abstract**: Preparation of low-energy quantum many-body states has a wide range of
applications in quantum information processing and condensed matter physics.
Quantum cooling algorithms offer a promising alternative to other methods
based, for instance, on variational and adiabatic principles, or on dissipative
state preparation. In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in
a simple, solvable fermionic model which allows us to identify the mechanisms
which underlie the cooling process and, also, those which prevent it. We derive
analytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling
rates in the weak coupling limit. We find that multi-frequency and randomized
cycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum
algorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of
noise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible.
Furthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly
enhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare
cooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed
here, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.

**Abstract**: This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal
transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures
focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism
has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based
on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric
effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry
of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction.
Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that
emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced
applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and
altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal
and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary
superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been
explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers
has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials,
including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally
biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in
recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and
various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large
thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications
in superconductor-based thermal device components.

**Abstract**: Current leading theories of physics such as the Big Bang, the standard model
of particle physics, and general relativity suggest that the universe should
contain an equal amount of matter and antimatter. Yet observations have found a
disproportionately large amount of matter, a phenomenon known as the baryon
assymmetry problem. Since century-old established theories are traditionally
impossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining
antimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the
existence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable
Antimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a
framework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists,
and thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy. Our
method is the firing of neurons in our brains, typically known as a thought
experiment. We still have no idea why or how this works, but it must be good
because most of science was created this way. Our results are the result of our
methods, which result in some text and the resulting conclusions. In order to
encourage the reader to reach the end of this short paper, we do not want to
spoil the conclusions here. Instead, the conclusions will conclude the paper.

**Abstract**: In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$
colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam
polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies
available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility
first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with
technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In
addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as
opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\&D facilities as part of a
linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all
plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer,
independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\&D for
advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals,
early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision
team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the
LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades
of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the
context of CLIC and ILC.


### Which features of quantum physics are not fundamentally quantum but are due to indeterminism?

**Abstract**: What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems,
and paradoxes -- such as the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend paradox
and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning --
allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a classical analogue if one is to
interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really
characterizes non-classical effects are incompatible physical quantities,
which, in quantum quantum theory are associated to the fundamental constant
$\hbar$.

**Abstract**: Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network
development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by
synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large
language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without
costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in
simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we
introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$
framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel
conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task
specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that
can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach
successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains
controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks,
four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we
demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that
achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.


### NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation

**PDF Url**: [2503.24322v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24322v1)

**Abstract**: The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a
gradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the
output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural
networks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below,
this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features
live on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are
expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning
method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards
propagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching
methods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We
believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of
gradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical
representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the
representation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target,
learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable
learning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and
computationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free
methods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm,
NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more
efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other
characteristics of the learning process.


### Enhancing Image Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: A Latent Diffusion Model Approach

**Abstract**: The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding
the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects.
However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the
ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these
older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles,
enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic
network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach
for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the
higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).
By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI
data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution
of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the
reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and
LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux
or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with
different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models
(DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past
for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis
in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller
than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their
reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to
super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can
also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.


### Visual Acoustic Fields

**Abstract**: Objects produce different sounds when hit, and humans can intuitively infer
how an object might sound based on its appearance and material properties.
Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that
bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and
sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional
diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a
feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the
sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the
feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound
sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for
collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between
captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in
a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds
and accurately localizing impact sources. Our project page is at

**Abstract**: Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are
long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance
high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging
event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond
temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in
either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this
paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion
deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event
streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we
introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral,
achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we
propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the
edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and
real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing
significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.

**Abstract**: The stock market, as a cornerstone of the financial markets, places
forecasting stock price movements at the forefront of challenges in
quantitative finance. Emerging learning-based approaches have made significant
progress in capturing the intricate and ever-evolving data patterns of modern
markets. With the rapid expansion of the stock market, it presents two
characteristics, i.e., stock exogeneity and volatility heterogeneity, that
heighten the complexity of price forecasting. Specifically, while stock
exogeneity reflects the influence of external market factors on price
movements, volatility heterogeneity showcases the varying difficulty in
movement forecasting against price fluctuations. In this work, we introduce the
framework of Cross-market Synergy with Pseudo-volatility Optimization (CSPO).
Specifically, CSPO implements an effective deep neural architecture to leverage
external futures knowledge. This enriches stock embeddings with cross-market
insights and thus enhances the CSPO's predictive capability. Furthermore, CSPO
incorporates pseudo-volatility to model stock-specific forecasting confidence,
enabling a dynamic adaptation of its optimization process to improve accuracy
and robustness. Our extensive experiments, encompassing industrial evaluation
and public benchmarking, highlight CSPO's superior performance over existing
methods and effectiveness of all proposed modules contained therein.
