**Abstract**: We use density functional theory (DFT) with non-empirically tuned screened
range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals to calculate the electronic
properties of native zinc and oxygen vacancy point defects in ZnO, and we
predict their defect levels for thermal and optical transitions in excellent
agreement with available experiments and prior calculations that use empirical
hybrid functionals. The ability of this non-empirical first-principles
framework to accurately predict quantities of relevance to both bulk and defect
level spectroscopy enables high-accuracy DFT calculations with non-empirical
hybrid functionals for defect physics, at a reduced computational cost.

**Abstract**: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rotating machinery is critical
for industrial safety and maintenance, but existing methods struggle with
scarce target-domain data and unclear degradation dynamics. We propose a
Meta-Learning and Knowledge Discovery-based Physics-Informed Neural Network
(MKDPINN) to address these challenges. The method first maps noisy sensor data
to a low-dimensional hidden state space via a Hidden State Mapper (HSM). A
Physics-Guided Regulator (PGR) then learns unknown nonlinear PDEs governing
degradation evolution, embedding these physical constraints into the PINN
framework. This integrates data-driven and physics-based approaches. The
framework uses meta-learning, optimizing across source-domain meta-tasks to
enable few-shot adaptation to new target tasks. Experiments on industrial data
and the C-MAPSS benchmark show MKDPINN outperforms baselines in generalization
and accuracy, proving its effectiveness for RUL prediction under data scarcity

**Abstract**: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment
Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical
and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction
accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These
efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as
target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome
only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and
electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.

**Abstract**: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for
enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven
approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and
system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially
important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal
loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear
or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to
degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and
remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a
physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts
internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this
mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode
interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an
equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction
forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware
iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture
influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller
bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling
elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler
GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting
loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It
outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering
stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation.
Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining
comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital
twins, design, and maintenance.

**Abstract**: In future colliders, the frontiers of luminosity and energy are extended to
explore the physics of elementary particles at extremely high precision, and to
discover new phenomena suggested from current experimental anomalies. In this
letter, we present a simple method to estimate the expected statistical
uncertainties of scattering cross sections at future colliders using their
conceptual design reports. In particular, the expected statistical
uncertainties of muon pair production cross section at the Future Circular
Collider (FCC-ee) and the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) are
calculated. The results can be used to set a goal for systematic uncertainty
improvement, to determine the standard model parameters accurately, and to
identify the viable parameter space of new physics models.

**Abstract**: Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a
visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by
neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of
photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent
interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral
geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently
linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing
apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the
conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link
is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship
between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first
time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The
main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model
that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to
explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception
phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic
considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color
perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that
summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the
framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile
trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic
properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or
experimental assumption.

**Abstract**: Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) is rapidly gaining
interest from those within many disciplines and higher education needs to adapt
to the changing landscape. Although QISE education still has a strong presence
and roots in physics, the field is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary.
There is a need to understand the presence of QISE instruction and
quantum-related instruction across all disciplines in order to figure out where
QISE education is already happening and where it could be expanded. Although
there is recent work that characterizes introductory QISE courses, there is no
holistic picture of the landscape of QISE and quantum-related education in the
United States. We analyzed course catalogs from 1,456 U.S. institutions. We
found 61 institutions offering QISE degree programs, mostly at PhD-granting
schools, with physics, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and computer
science(CS) as their primary contributors . Across all institutions, we
identified over 8,000 courses mentioning 'quantum,' but about one-third of
institutions in our study had none. We also found over 500 dedicated QISE
courses, concentrated in PhD-granting institutions, primarily in physics, ECE,
and CS. Physics leads in offering both general quantum-related ($\sim$4,700)
and QISE-specific ($\sim$200) courses. Across multiple disciplines, we see that
QISE topics are being introduced in courses not fully dedicated to QISE, which
may be a productive strategy for increasing access to QISE education. Our
dataset and analysis provide the most comprehensive overview to date of quantum
education across US higher education. To ensure broad access, all data are
publicly available and downloadable at quantumlandscape.streamlit.app. We hope
these findings will support and guide future efforts in curriculum design,
workforce development, and education policy across the quantum ecosystem.

**Abstract**: Monolithic stitched CMOS sensors are explored for the upgrade of Inner
Tracking System of the ALICE experiment (ITS3) and the R&D of the CERN
Experimental Physics Department. To learn about stitching, two 26 cm long
stitched sensors, the Monolithic Stitched Sensor (MOSS), and the Monolithic
Stitched Sensor with Timing (MOST), were implemented in the Engineering Round 1
(ER1) in the TPSCo 65nm ISC technology. Contrary to the MOSS, powered by 20
distinct power domains accessible from separate pads, the MOST has one global
analog and digital power domain to or from which small fractions of the matrix
can be connected or disconnected by conservatively designed power switches to
prevent shorts or defects from affecting the full chip. Instead of the
synchronous readout in the MOSS, the MOST immediately transfers hit information
upon a hit, preserving timing information. The sensor reverse bias is also
applied through the bias of the front-end rather than by a reverse substrate
bias. This paper presents the first characterization results of the MOST, with
the focus on its specific characteristics, including yield analysis, precise
timing measurements, and the potential of its alternative biasing approach for
improved sensor performance.

**Abstract**: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful tool for approximating
quantum wavefunctions using deep learning. While these models achieve
remarkable accuracy, understanding how they encode physical information remains
an open challenge. In this work, we introduce adiabatic fine-tuning, a scheme
that trains NQS across a phase diagram, leading to strongly correlated weight
representations across different models. This correlation in weight space
enables the detection of phase transitions in quantum systems by analyzing the
trained network weights alone. We validate our approach on the transverse field
Ising model and the J1-J2 Heisenberg model, demonstrating that phase
transitions manifest as distinct structures in weight space. Our results
establish a connection between physical phase transitions and the geometry of
neural network parameters, opening new directions for the interpretability of
machine learning models in physics.

**Abstract**: Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of
transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal
representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output
vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is
technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the
richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al.
(2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize
intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion
models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize
residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the
direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach
that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We
validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides
an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.

**PDF Url**: [2504.11713v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11713v2)

**Abstract**: We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for
learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy
functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more
gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples,
allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored
by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic
optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching,
being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples
towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as
well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian
and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale
up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer
generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in
developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these
challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress
in computational chemistry.

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing
high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly
render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack
of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use
external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher
computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated
dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized
from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and
spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible
fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to
enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation
time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we
propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing
3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These
metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully
mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further
improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the
current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial
consistency benchmarks.


### Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the
appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be
equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present
a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than
uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of
information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization
does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a
tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained
model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the
entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled
entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and
ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the
inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image
quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can
be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization
without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater
improvements in the few NFEs regime.


### Task Assignment and Exploration Optimization for Low Altitude UAV Rescue via Generative AI Enhanced Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Xin Tang, Qian Chen, Wenjie Weng, Chao Jin, Zhang Liu, Jiacheng Wang, Geng Sun, Xiaohuan Li, Dusit Niyato

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance
rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed
aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown
environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single
UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the
limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots
(GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling
through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide
computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the
multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration
optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective
is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring
system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov
optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability
constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an
algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a
generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a
method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting
with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent
deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment
decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant
improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system
stability compared to baseline methods.
