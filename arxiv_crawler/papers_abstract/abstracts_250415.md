**Abstract**: Neutrino oscillations constitute an excellent tool to probe physics beyond
the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the \ess
experiment to constrain the effects of flavour-dependent long-range forces
(LRFs) in neutrino oscillations, which may arise due to the extension of the
Standard Model gauge group by introducing new $U(1)$ symmetries. Focusing on
three specific $U(1)$ symmetries -- $L_e - L_\mu$, $L_e - L_\tau$, and $L_\mu -
L_\tau$, we demonstrate that \ess offers a favourable environment to search for
LRF effects. Our analyses reveal that \ess can set 90\% confidence level bounds
of $V_{e\mu} < 2.99 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, $V_{e\tau} < 2.05 \times
10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, and $V_{\mu\tau} < 1.81 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$,
which are competitive to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE). It is also observed that reducing the systematic uncertainties from
$5\%$ to $2\%$ improves the \ess limits on $V_{\alpha\beta}$. Interestingly, we
find limited correlations between LRF parameters and the less constrained
lepton mixing parameters $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$, preserving the
robustness of ESSnuSB's sensitivity to CP violation. Even under extreme LRF
potentials ($V_{\alpha\beta} \gg 10^{-13} \, \text{eV}$), the CP-violation
sensitivity and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ precision remain largely unaffected. These
results establish ESSnuSB as a competitive experimental setup for probing LRF
effects, complementing constraints from other neutrino sources and offering
critical insights into the physics of long-range forces.

**Abstract**: PIONEER is a rapidly developing effort aimed to perform a pristine test of
lepton flavour universality (LFU) and of the unitarity of the first row of the
CKM matrix by significantly improving the measurements of rare decays of the
charged pion. In Phase I, PIONEER aims to measure the charged-pion branching
ratio to electrons vs.\ muons $R_{e/\mu}$ to 1 part in $10^4$, improving the
current experimental result $R_{e/\mu}\,\text{(exp)} =1.2327(23)\times10^{-4}$
by a factor of 15. This precision on $R_{e/\mu}$ will match the theoretical
accuracy of the SM prediction allowing for a test of LFU at an unprecedented
level, probing non-SM explanations of LFU violation through sensitivity to
quantum effects of new particles up to the PeV mass scale. Phase II and III
will aim to improve the experimental precision of the branching ratio of pion
beta decay, $\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+ \nu (\gamma)$, currently at
$1.036(6)\times10^{-8}$, by a factor of three and six, respectively. The
improved measurements will be used to extract $V_{ud}$ in a theoretically
pristine manner. The ultimate precision of $V_{ud}$ is expected to reach the
0.05\,\% level, allowing for a stringent test of CKM unitarity. The PIONEER
experiment will also improve the experimental limits by an order of magnitude
or more on a host of exotic decays that probe the effects of heavy neutrinos
and dark sector physics. This input to the 2026 update of the European Strategy
for Particle Physics Strategy describes the physics motivation and the
conceptual design of the PIONEER experiment, and is prepared based on the
PIONEER proposal submitted to and approved with high priority by the PSI
program advisory committee (PAC). Using intense pion beams, and
state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational resources, the PIONEER
experiment is aiming to begin data taking by the end of this decade.

**Abstract**: At Arizona State University we have built the first and only fully online
Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, with a complete curriculum, including
labs. The upper division Advanced Lab courses present a special challenge for
online delivery. We address that using a set of custom-built simulator modules
that replicate all the imperfections (noise, background, etc) inherent in
real-world data. The set of experiments duplicates those of the in-person
classes. In this paper, we present an overview of these labs and discuss the
advantages and challenges of delivering them online. We assert that these labs
provide a valid and rigorous component for the fully online degree. The entire
set of labs is available as Open Source Supplemental Materials and is shared
for others to use in part or in whole, with suitable attribution.

**Abstract**: Investigating $K$-shell hollow atom spectra enhances our understanding of
femtosecond phenomena in atomic physics, chemistry, and biology. Synchrotron
measurements of two-electron one-photon (TEOP) transitions in low-$Z$ atoms
have revealed discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical
predictions of TEOP relative intensities. These discrepancies appear to
originate from an incomplete description of an atom's response to the strong
perturbation caused by $K$-shell double photoionization (DPI). The
multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock relativistic configuration interaction
method has been applied for studying the TEOP spectra of Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and
Ca atoms. The results show that branching ratios can be accurately reproduced
by accounting for the effects of core and valence electron correlations, as
well as the outer-shell ionization and excitation processes following $K$-shell
DPI.

**Abstract**: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion
interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in
QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a
two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical
coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and
suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and
quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark
condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV
completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include
effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the
Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a
significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a
successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that
is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the
naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics
should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to
the LHC.

**Abstract**: We introduce the stellar decomposition, a novel method for characterizing
non-Gaussian states produced by photon-counting measurements on Gaussian
states. Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode
"Gaussian core state" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation
T that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian
core state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the
photon-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a
core state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and
finite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all
non-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis.
For pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with
G_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a
Gaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the
"largest" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar
decomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic
circuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a
new characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann
picture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides
novel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for
understanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.

**Abstract**: We propose a high-precision, fast, robust and cost-effective muon detector
concept for an FCC-ee experiment. This design combines precision drift tubes
with fast plastic scintillator strips to enable both spatial and timing
measurements. The drift tubes deliver two-dimensional position measurements
perpendicular to the tubes with a resolution around 100~$\mu$m. Meanwhile, the
scintillator strips, read out with the wavelength-shifting fibers and silicon
photomultipliers, provide fast timing information with a precision of 200~ps or
better and measure the third coordinate along the tubes with a resolution of
about 1~mm.

**Abstract**: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&A...692A.140A}
revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter
counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the
presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole
(BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a
millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure,
with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs.
non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk
(DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA
observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over
an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a
distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All
Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in
the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable,
the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and
decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on
modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1
reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate
sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field
evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during
the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an
outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio
variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and
magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active
galactic nuclei.


### No reliable studies of climate change without Henry's Law and a new thermometer for the global temperature
**Authors**: Jyrki Kauppinen, Pekka Malmi

**Published Date**: 2023-04-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-14

**PDF Url**: [2304.01245v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01245v2)

**Abstract**: In our previous paper "No experimental evidence for the significant
anthropogenic climate change" we had a reference to this paper. Thus, we have
presented a new theory: how Henry's Law regulates the concentration of CO$_2$
in the atmosphere. This theory uses a physically perfect unit impulse response
to convolve signals. By comparing the theory and the present observations we
are able to derive the response time about 7.4 years, which is roughly the
residence time of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. In addition, according to Henry's
Law we can derive the temperature dependence of the equilibrium concentration
of CO$_2$. It turns out that now the major increase of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere
is due to the temperature change, the reason for which is approximately a
change of cloudiness ($90\%$) and the rest ($10\%$) the greenhouse effect. The
corresponding increase of CO$_2$ is $83$~ppm/$^\circ$C. According to our
theory, the causality is very clear: the increase of the temperature results in
more CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. This further CO$_2$ concentration increases also
the temperature but less than $10\%$ via the greenhouse effect. The human
contribution to the CO$_2$ concentration and the temperature is very small.
About $90\%$ of a big human release of CO$_2$ dissolves in water. That is why
the human release now warms the climate less than $0.03 ^\circ$C. We can also
perform an inverse operation or calculate the temperature profile from the
observed CO$_2$ curve. So we propose a new thermometer for the global surface
temperature. This can be used almost in real time and it is more accurate than
the present methods. It turns out that probably also N$_2$O and SF$_6$
concentrations in the atmosphere operate as global thermometers.


### Compatibilidad del Argumento Cosmológico Kalam con la Ciencia Contemporánea

**PDF Url**: [2302.11022v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11022v2)

**Abstract**: The Kalam cosmological argument, of a metaphysical nature, asserts that the
universe had a first cause. This study examines the compatibility of its
premises through a bibliographic review of advancements in contemporary
physics. Quantum theory demonstrates that quantum phenomena are indeterministic
and non-causal. Even in deterministic theories, causality lacks a clear
definition. Moreover, cosmological models, such as cosmic inflation, suggest
that the early stages of the universe do not require a first cause. In
conclusion, the premises of the Kalam argument are not compatible with
contemporary physics.


## Diffusion
### REPA-E: Unlocking VAE for End-to-End Tuning with Latent Diffusion Transformers

**PDF Url**: [2504.10483v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10483v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent
diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in
an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that
end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent
diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and
diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a
degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is
ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the
representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model
to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the
proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up
diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training
recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with
REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure
and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our
approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and
without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256. Code is available at

**Abstract**: Terrain modeling has traditionally relied on procedural techniques, which
often require extensive domain expertise and handcrafted rules. In this paper,
we present MESA - a novel data-centric alternative by training a diffusion
model on global remote sensing data. This approach leverages large-scale
geospatial information to generate high-quality terrain samples from text
descriptions, showcasing a flexible and scalable solution for terrain
generation. The model's capabilities are demonstrated through extensive
experiments, highlighting its ability to generate realistic and diverse terrain
landscapes. The dataset produced to support this work, the Major TOM Core-DEM
extension dataset, is released openly as a comprehensive resource for global
terrain data. The results suggest that data-driven models, trained on remote
sensing data, can provide a powerful tool for realistic terrain modeling and
generation.


### GAF: Gaussian Avatar Reconstruction from Monocular Videos via Multi-view Diffusion

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-14

**PDF Url**: [2412.10209v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10209v2)

**Abstract**: We propose a novel approach for reconstructing animatable 3D Gaussian avatars
from monocular videos captured by commodity devices like smartphones.
Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is
challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions
under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this
problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors
to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting
renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered
from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive
biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from
the input image to preserve facial identity and appearance details. For
Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using
iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating
over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent
upsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an
image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from
monocular videos captured on commodity devices.


### Improving Decoupled Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems using Data Consistency Constraint

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems
through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps.
To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been
recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores
measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization
in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled
Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the
reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the
optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the
target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion
models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS
on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks
under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy
over existing methods.


### Efficient Generative Model Training via Embedded Representation Warmup

**PDF Url**: [2504.10188v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10188v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in
training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised
methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality,
semantically rich representations during training notably slows down
convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation
processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and
structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address
this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play
framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup
that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality,
pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning
representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting
performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends
on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the
representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and
transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish
that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances
representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$
acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ERW.
