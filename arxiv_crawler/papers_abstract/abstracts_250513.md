**Abstract**: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in
open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific
supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic
reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a
compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However,
their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether
imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap
between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),
an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration
is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to
deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to
abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,
predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences
through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop
environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful
exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the
entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports
downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the
performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

**Abstract**: Recent searches by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
in the `diphoton plus $b\bar{b}$ final state' have revealed an excess near 650
GeV, which might indicate the presence of a (broad) heavy resonance decaying
into a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and an additional particle. At the same
time, both ATLAS and CMS as well as all experiments at the Large
Electron-Position (LEP) collider have reported excesses consistent with a light
Higgs boson channel around 95 GeV, suggesting a potential connection between
these two signals. In this study, we investigate these anomalies within the
context of the CP-conserving 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type~III. In our
proposed scenario, a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ with a mass near 650 GeV
decays into a SM-like Higgs boson $H$ and a $Z$ boson, with the $H$ boson
subsequently decaying into diphotons and the $Z$ boson decaying into $b\bar{b}$
pairs. To explain the excess around 95 GeV, we independently select the mass of
the light CP-even Higgs boson of the model $h$ to be around this value. This
configuration allows for a consistent explanation of both the high- and
low-mass excesses observed in the experiments. Through a detailed analysis, we
demonstrate that these two signals can be fitted simultaneously at the
2.5$\sigma$ significance level, offering a promising solution to the observed
anomalies and potentially hinting at new physics Beyond the Standard Model
(BSM).


### Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU): conventional, hybrid, and neural network material model discovery including history-dependency
**Authors**: Bernardo P. Ferreira, Miguel A. Bessa

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07801v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07801v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU)
framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field
displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from
strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update
conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material
models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or
additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model
architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is
extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions
of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully
differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps
that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched
execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to
facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model
architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is
released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully
designed and documented software named HookeAI.


### Mixed state deep thermalization
**Authors**: Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos

**Published Date**: 2025-05-12

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07795v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07795v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a
collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body
system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are
incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected
ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has
been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on
symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in
quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated
by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the
limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the
size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that
they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the
literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality.
Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states
composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum
information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper
bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp
transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of
that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate
the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which
are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein
measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and
natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.


### Unconventional Fractional Phases in Multi-Band Vortexable Systems
**Authors**: Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaohan Wan, Ang-Kun Wu, Shi-Zeng Lin, Kai Sun

**PDF Url**: [2505.07790v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07790v1)

**Abstract**: In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that
deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal
quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena
fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we
find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable
systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While
the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands
separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack
of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose
Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical
and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional
quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as
possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems,
we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new
fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire
unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.


### Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization
**Authors**: Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde

**Abstract**: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list
of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number
or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum
energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a
semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over
the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space.
These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization
communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are
essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by
quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the
aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant
solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is
concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard
(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these
parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low
temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for
the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent
approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it
can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the
algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum
thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why
algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the
matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient
update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at
solving SDPs.


### Solving Nonlinear PDEs with Sparse Radial Basis Function Networks
**Authors**: Zihan Shao, Konstantin Pieper, Xiaochuan Tian

**Published Date**: 2025-05-12

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07765v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07765v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a novel framework for solving nonlinear PDEs using sparse radial
basis function (RBF) networks. Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to
prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is
motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods,
along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in
a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the
function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by
one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a
representer theorem showing that the solution to the sparse optimization
problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that
offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The
algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain
computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order
optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers
notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for
adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient,
learning-inspired implementation.


### Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation
**Authors**: D. Karlovets, A. Chaikovskaia, D. Grosman, D. Kargina, A. Shchepkin, G. Sizykh

**Published Date**: 2024-10-31

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2411.00212v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00212v3)

**Abstract**: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities
in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of
applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of
atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range -
dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a
theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov
radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a
fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite
formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative
nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the
electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be
either positive or negative and necessitates going beyond the far-field
approximation. The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the
relevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its
atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the
Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting
packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon
emission.


### Effective Field Theory Description of Hawking Radiation
**Authors**: David A. Lowe, Larus Thorlacius

**Published Date**: 2025-05-12

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07722v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07722v1)

**Abstract**: A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using
effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a
general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. The
semiclassical stress tensor is evaluated in a Schwarzschild background taking a
time-independent limit for the quantum state. Imposing physical boundary
conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to
the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In
particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal
effective action.


### Electron Wave-Spin Qubit
**Authors**: Ju Gao, Fang Shen

**Published Date**: 2025-04-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2504.18824v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18824v3)

**Abstract**: This work proposes a wave-entity perspective of the electron spin qubit,
treating the electron as a continuous physical wave rather than a point-like
particle. In this theoretical framework, each spin qubit corresponds to a
distinct current density configuration, offering a resolution to the paradox of
a particle appearing to spin both up and down simultaneously. We further
predict the existence of a persistent, azimuthally asymmetric magnetic field
associated with the wave-spin qubit, an effect not anticipated by the
conventional particle-spin model. Notably, the qubit's relative phase governs
the orientation of both the current and the magnetic field, suggesting a
mechanism for direct, local interactions between qubits. This phase-dependent
coupling could form the basis for inherently parallel quantum computing
architectures, in contrast to the sequential operations of gate-based logic.
While this framework is grounded in theoretical analysis, it yields testable
predictions -- particularly regarding the magnetic field structure -- that
invite experimental verification. By treating the electron wave as the
fundamental physical entity, rather than a probabilistic abstraction, we
explore a quantum model that is deterministic, local, causal, and fully
consistent with special relativity.


## Diffusion
### H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP: Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy for Visuomotor Learning
**Authors**: Yiyang Lu, Yufeng Tian, Zhecheng Yuan, Xianbang Wang, Pu Hua, Zhengrong Xue, Huazhe Xu

**Published Date**: 2025-05-12

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07819v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07819v1)

**Abstract**: Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic
manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models
to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the
critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this
work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion
Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework
that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the
integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains
$\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes
RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual
representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity;
and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the
generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$
average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation
tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual
real-world manipulation tasks. Project Page: https://lyy-iiis.github.io/h3dp/.


### Prompt to Polyp: Medical Text-Conditioned Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Mikhail Chaichuk, Sushant Gautam, Steven Hicks, Elena Tutubalina

**Published Date**: 2025-05-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.05573v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05573v2)

**Abstract**: The generation of realistic medical images from text descriptions has
significant potential to address data scarcity challenges in healthcare AI
while preserving patient privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive study of
text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct
approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2)
training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM,
an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical
text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better
align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two
approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus
training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy
(MedVQA-GI) and radiology (ROCOv2) datasets reveals that while large models
achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with
lower computational costs. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations by
medical experts reveal strengths and limitations of each approach.


### BNEM: A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Noised Energy Matching
**Authors**: RuiKang OuYang, Bo Qiang, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato

**Published Date**: 2024-09-15

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.09787v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09787v4)

**Abstract**: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and
identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a
crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this
work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data
sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised
data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which
theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works.
Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance
between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The
experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art
performance while being more robust.

**Authors**: Riccardo Passoni, Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Romain Serizel, Fabio Antonacci

**Published Date**: 2025-05-12

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07615v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07615v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for
generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational
demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In
this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art
text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent
variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference
time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and
energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected
models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance
and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient
generative audio models.


### Noise Optimized Conditional Diffusion for Domain Adaptation
**Authors**: Lingkun Luo, Shiqiang Hu, Liming Chen

**Published Date**: 2025-05-12

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-12

**PDF Url**: [2505.07548v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07548v1)

**Abstract**: Pseudo-labeling is a cornerstone of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), yet
the scarcity of High-Confidence Pseudo-Labeled Target Domain Samples
(\textbf{hcpl-tds}) often leads to inaccurate cross-domain statistical
alignment, causing DA failures. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{N}oise \textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion for
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly
integrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the
decision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for
efficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA
classifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified
optimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain
samples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},
\mathbf{I}) \) initialization in diffusion models often generates
class-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we
introduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling
regions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing
cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments across 5 benchmark datasets and
29 DA tasks demonstrate significant performance gains of \textbf{NOCDDA} over
31 state-of-the-art methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness.
