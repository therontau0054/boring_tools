**Abstract**: We derive a new family of quantum error-correcting codes. The main technical
tool used to do so is the physically intuitive concept of condensation, which
is employed to create new domain walls between the quantum double of $\Z_4$ and
an instance of the doubled semion phase. Specifically, we provide explicit
constructions, first at the lattice-level and then subsequently at the
macroscopic logical-level. To provide intuition, we provide a series of
explicit examples using the derived topological interfaces. We discuss the
code's utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error-correction with an
emphasis on the interplay between logical error rates and decoding.
  We conclude by outlining how such codes' representation and design can be
automated. We expect our results, which provide explicit step-by-step
instructions in the form of algorithms, to pave the path for new
higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in
configurations that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.

**Abstract**: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its
interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties.
Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of
devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole
mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At
deep cryogenic temperatures (< 50mK), the transport characteristics transition
from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced
Fabry-P\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility
of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake
device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of
the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed
underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a
promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as
topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.

**Abstract**: In this study, we provide a novel wave packet propagation method that
generalizes the Hagedorn approach by introducing alternative primitive basis
sets that are better suited to describe different physical processes. More
precisely, in our propagation scheme, we can mix basis sets with time-dependent
parameters (the Hagedorn basis set) and time-independent ones, such as Fourier
series, particle-in-a-box, or harmonic oscillator basis sets. Furthermore, our
implementation can handle models with several electronic states, so that
non-adiabatic processes can be studied. Instead of the time-dependent
variational principle, our propagation scheme uses a three-step procedure
(standard propagation, time-dependent parameter evaluation, and projection). It
relies on multidimensional integrations, which are performed numerically with
Gaussian quadrature, so that we have no constraints on the for of the
Hamiltonian operator. This numerical algorithm has been implemented in a modern
Fortran code available on GitHub (https://github.com/asodoga/TD_Schrod_Rabiou).
  The code has been tested and validated by comparisons with standard
propagation schemes on 2D-models with harmonic and anharmonic potentials
(modified H\'enon-Heiles). More precisely, our benchmark tests show that the
wave packets obtained with our propagation scheme are able to converge to exact
wave packets (obtained from standard propagation techniques). Finally, we have
applied our method to compute the vibrational spectrum of the 6D-modified
H\'enon-Heiles model and we show that our scheme reproduces well the results
obtained with the standard approach and with smaller basis functions. As a
perspective, we show that with the generalized Hagedorn wave packet method, we
are able to study the non-adiabtic dynamics of the cis-trans retinal
isomerization in a reduced 2D-model with two coupled electronic surfaces.

**PDF Url**: [2506.19136v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19136v2)

**Abstract**: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on
the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.

**Abstract**: ColdADC is a custom ASIC digitizer implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology using
specialized techniques for long-term reliability in cryogenic environments.
ColdADC was developed for use in the DUNE Far Detector complex, which will
consist of four liquid argon time projection chambers. Each contains 17
kilotons liquid argon as the target material in order to measure neutrino
oscillations. Approximately 40,000 ColdADC ASICs will be installed for DUNE in
the first two large detectors and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures
during the experiment without replacement. The lifetime of the ColdADC is a
critical parameter affecting the data quality and physics sensitivity of the
experiment. A measurement of the lifetime of the ColdADC was carried out, and
the results shown in this paper assure orders of magnitude longer lifetime of
the ColdADC than the planned operation time of the detectors.


### LSD-3D: Large-Scale 3D Driving Scene Generation with Geometry Grounding

**Abstract**: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.


### From Tabula Rasa to Emergent Abilities: Discovering Robot Skills via Real-World Unsupervised Quality-Diversity

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-26

**PDF Url**: [2508.19172v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19172v1)

**Abstract**: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

### Architecting Distributed Quantum Computers: Design Insights from Resource Estimation
**Authors**: Dmitry Filippov, Peter Yang, Prakash Murali

**Published Date**: 2025-08-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-26

**PDF Url**: [2508.19160v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19160v1)

**Abstract**: To enable practically useful quantum computing, we require hundreds to
thousands of logical qubits (collections of physical qubits with error
correction). Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond
few tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that
orchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing
system. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining
hardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our
work fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about
distributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application
resource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of
entanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we
develop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of
the distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical
quantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit
speeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that
distributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for
a node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher
number of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic
architectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects. Our
insights on entanglement generation rates, node sizes and architecture have the
potential to inform system designs in the coming years.


### Uncertainty-Resilient Active Intention Recognition for Robotic Assistants

**Abstract**: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

### VibeVoice Technical Report

**PDF Url**: [2508.19205v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19205v1)

**Abstract**: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.


### Planning-Query-Guided Model Generation for Model-Based Deformable Object Manipulation

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-26

**PDF Url**: [2508.19199v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19199v1)

**Abstract**: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.


### RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration
**Authors**: Yan Chen, Yi Wen, Wei Li, Junchao Liu, Yong Guo, Jie Hu, Xinghao Chen

**Published Date**: 2025-08-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-26

**PDF Url**: [2508.19154v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19154v1)

**Abstract**: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.


### Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory
**Authors**: Robin Thériault, Daniele Tantari

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-26

**PDF Url**: [2508.19151v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19151v1)

**Abstract**: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.


### Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning
**Authors**: Shervin Khalafi, Ignacio Hounie, Dongsheng Ding, Alejandro Ribeiro

**Published Date**: 2025-08-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-26

**PDF Url**: [2508.19104v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19104v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at
https://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align.
