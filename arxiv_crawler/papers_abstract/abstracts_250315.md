**Abstract**: Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional
morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential
for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as
reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive
reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning
offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations,
which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion
models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of
various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we
propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor
skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to
unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation
learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons
by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with
video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented
video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks
involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we
demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines
trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of
leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with
diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data
generation for imitation learning.

**Abstract**: We solve Diophantine equations of the type $ a \, (x^3 \!+ \! y^3 \!+ \! z^3
) = (x \! + \! y \! + \! z)^3$, where $x,y,z$ are integer variables, and the
coefficient $a\neq 0$ is rational. We show that there are infinite families of
such equations, including those where $a$ is any cube or certain rational
fractions, that have nontrivial solutions. There are also infinite families of
equations that do not have any nontrivial solution, including those where $1/a
= 1- 24/m$ with restrictions on the integer $m$. The equations can be
represented by elliptic curves unless $a = 9$ or 1, and any elliptic curve of
nonzero $j$-invariant and torsion group $\mathbb{Z}/3k\mathbb{Z}$ for $k =
2,3,4$, or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} $ corresponds
to a particular $a$. We prove that for any $a$ the number of nontrivial
solutions is at most 3 or is infinite, and for integer $a$ it is either 0 or
$\infty$. For $a = 9$, we find the general solution, which depends on two
integer parameters. These cubic equations are important in particle physics,
because they determine the fermion charges under the $U(1)$ gauge group.

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many
perception-focused tasks, however, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks
seem to be limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data.
In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused
multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that
leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning
multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with
meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to
identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs
from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction,
filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K
question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA
pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant
performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point
gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain.
Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B
parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath
(55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in
enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.


### Benchmarking low-power flopping-mode spin qubit fidelities in Si/SiGe devices with alloy disorder

**Abstract**: In the "flopping-mode" regime of electron spin resonance, a single electron
confined in a double quantum dot is electrically driven in the presence of a
magnetic field gradient. The increased dipole moment of the charge in the
flopping mode significantly reduces the amount of power required to drive spin
rotations. However, the susceptibility of flopping-mode spin qubits to charge
noise, and consequently their overall performance, has not been examined in
detail. In this work, we simulate single-qubit gate fidelities of electrically
driven spin rotations in an ensemble of devices configured to operate in both
the single-dot and flopping-mode regimes. Our model accounts for the valley
physics of conduction band electrons in silicon and realistic alloy disorder in
the SiGe barrier layers, allowing us to investigate device-to-device
variability. We include charge and magnetic noise, as well as spin relaxation
processes arising from charge noise and electron-phonon coupling. We find that
the two operating modes exhibit significantly different susceptibilities to the
various noise sources, with valley splitting and spin relaxation times also
playing a role in their relative performance. For realistic noise strengths, we
find that single-dot gate fidelities are limited by magnetic noise while
flopping-mode fidelities are primarily limited by charge noise and spin
relaxation. For sufficiently long spin relaxation times, flopping-mode spin
operation is feasible with orders-of-magnitude lower drive power and gate
fidelities that are on par with conventional single-dot electric dipole spin
resonance.


### The Role of Sequence Information in Minimal Models of Molecular Assembly
**Authors**: Jeremy Guntoro, Thomas Ouldridge

**Published Date**: 2024-02-29

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-13

**PDF Url**: [2402.19225v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19225v2)

**Abstract**: Sequence-directed assembly processes - such as protein folding - allow the
assembly of a large number of structures with high accuracy from only a small
handful of fundamental building blocks. We aim to explore how efficiently
sequence information can be used to direct assembly by studying variants of the
temperature-1 abstract tile assembly model (aTAM). We ask whether, for each
variant, their exists a finite set of tile types that can deterministically
assemble any shape producible by a given assembly model; we call such tile type
sets "universal assembly kits". Our first model, which we call the "backboned
aTAM", generates backbone-assisted assembly by forcing tiles to be added to
lattice positions neighbouring the immediately preceding tile, using a
predetermined sequence of tile types. We demonstrate the existence of universal
assembly kit for the backboned aTAM, and show that the existence of this set is
maintained even under stringent restrictions to the rules of assembly. We
compare these results to a less constrained model that we call sequenced aTAM,
which also uses a predetermined sequence of tiles, but does not constrain a
tile to neighbour the immediately preceding tiles. We prove that this model has
no universal assembly kit in the stringent case. The lack of such a kit is
surprising, given that the number of tile sequences of length N scales faster
than both the number and worst-case Kolmogorov complexity of producible shapes
of size N for a sufficiently large - but finite - set of tiles. Our results
demonstrate the importance of physical mechanisms, and specifically geometric
constraints, in facilitating efficient use of the information in molecular
programs for structure assembly.


### The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory

**Abstract**: High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments,
particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods
rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and
discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a
domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features.
However, their relationship to IRT parameters remains underexplored. To address
this gap, we conducted a study involving over 7,000 multiple-choice questions
across various STEM subjects (e.g., math and biology). Using an automated
approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied
relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed
statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty
and discrimination parameters, particularly in life and physical science
domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality
more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors).
Overall, while IWFs are useful for predicting IRT parameters--particularly for
screening low-difficulty MCQs--they cannot replace traditional data-driven
validation methods. Our findings highlight the need for further research on
domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand
domain-specific content for robust item validation.


### Magneto-transport signatures in periodically-driven Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals
**Authors**: Shivam Yadav, Serena Fazzini, Ipsita Mandal

**Published Date**: 2022-03-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-13

**PDF Url**: [2203.04281v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04281v4)

**Abstract**: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic driving (for example, by
shining circularly polarized light) on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl
semimetals, in the planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups. We incorporate
the effects of the drive by using the Floquet formalism in the large frequency
limit. We evaluate the longitudinal magneto conductivity, planar Hall
conductivity, longitudinal thermo-electric coefficient, and transverse
thermo-electric coefficient, using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport
equations. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport
coefficients in certain limits of the parameters, where it is possible to
perform the integrals analytically. We cross-check our analytical
approximations by comparing the physical values with the numerical results,
obtained directly from the numerical integration of the integrals. The answers
obtained show that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals have
profound signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in
experiments.


### Why the Brain Cannot Be a Digital Computer: History-Dependence and the Computational Limits of Consciousness
**Authors**: Andrew Knight

**Published Date**: 2025-03-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-13

**PDF Url**: [2503.10518v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10518v1)

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic proof demonstrating that
the human brain as currently understood cannot function as a classical digital
computer. Through systematic quantification of distinguishable conscious states
and their historical dependencies, we establish that the minimum information
required to specify a conscious state exceeds the physical information capacity
of the human brain by a significant factor. Our analysis calculates the
bit-length requirements for representing consciously distinguishable sensory
"stimulus frames" and demonstrates that consciousness exhibits mandatory
temporal-historical dependencies that multiply these requirements beyond the
brain's storage capabilities. This mathematical approach offers new insights
into the fundamental limitations of computational models of consciousness and
suggests that non-classical information processing mechanisms may be necessary
to account for conscious experience.

**Authors**: Soumyajyoti Biswas, Bikas K. Chakrabarti, Asim Ghosh, Sourav Ghosh, Máté Józsa, Zoltán Néda

**Published Date**: 2025-03-11

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-13

**PDF Url**: [2503.08480v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08480v2)

**Abstract**: We study the inequality of citations received for different publications of
various researchers and Nobel laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and
Economics using their Google Scholar data for the period 2012-2024. Our
findings reveal that citation distributions are highly unequal, with even
greater disparity among the Nobel laureates. We then show that measures of
inequality, such as Gini and Kolkata indices, could be a useful indicator for
distinguishing the Nobel laureates from the others. It may be noted, such high
level of inequality corresponds to critical point fluctuations, indicating that
excellence correspond to (self-organized dynamical) critical point. We also
analyze the inequality in the medal tally of different countries in the summer
and winter Olympic games over the years, and find that a similar level of high
inequality exists there as well. Our results indicate that inequality measures
can serve as proxies for competitiveness and excellence.


### Video Super-Resolution: All You Need is a Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Zhihao Zhan, Wang Pang, Xiang Zhu, Yechao Bai

**Published Date**: 2025-03-05

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-13

**PDF Url**: [2503.03355v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03355v2)

**Abstract**: We present a generic video super-resolution algorithm in this paper, based on
the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework with an unconditional video
generation model in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion
transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model,
which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of
motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit
estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment.
Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer
model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has
strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.

### Studying Classifier(-Free) Guidance From a Classifier-Centric Perspective
**Authors**: Xiaoming Zhao, Alexander G. Schwing

**PDF Url**: [2503.10638v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10638v1)

**Abstract**: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with
denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of
classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an
empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance.
Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace
back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for
the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the
classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance
achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories
away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is
usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric
understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon
flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a
pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly
around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.


### AudioX: Diffusion Transformer for Anything-to-Audio Generation
**Authors**: Zeyue Tian, Yizhu Jin, Zhaoyang Liu, Ruibin Yuan, Xu Tan, Qifeng Chen, Wei Xue, Yike Guo

**PDF Url**: [2503.10522v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10522v1)

**Abstract**: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many
applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they
operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer
from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to
effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a
unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation.
Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio
and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control
and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image,
music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy
that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked
inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address
data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K
audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music
captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but
also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and
generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be
available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/


### Streaming Generation of Co-Speech Gestures via Accelerated Rolling Diffusion
**Authors**: Evgeniia Vu, Andrei Boiarov, Dmitry Vetrov

**Published Date**: 2025-03-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-03-13

**PDF Url**: [2503.10488v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10488v1)

**Abstract**: Generating co-speech gestures in real time requires both temporal coherence
and efficient sampling. We introduce Accelerated Rolling Diffusion, a novel
framework for streaming gesture generation that extends rolling diffusion
models with structured progressive noise scheduling, enabling seamless
long-sequence motion synthesis while preserving realism and diversity. We
further propose Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA), a new approach
that restructures the noise schedule into a stepwise ladder, allowing multiple
frames to be denoised simultaneously. This significantly improves sampling
efficiency while maintaining motion consistency, achieving up to a 2x speedup
with high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. We evaluate our approach on
ZEGGS and BEAT, strong benchmarks for real-world applicability. Our framework
is universally applicable to any diffusion-based gesture generation model,
transforming it into a streaming approach. Applied to three state-of-the-art
methods, it consistently outperforms them, demonstrating its effectiveness as a
generalizable and efficient solution for real-time, high-fidelity co-speech
gesture synthesis.
