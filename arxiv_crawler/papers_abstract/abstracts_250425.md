**Abstract**: When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does
not obey $U^{\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not
lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different
form. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due
to $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must
exist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$, so that
$V^{-1}U^{\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with
decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation.
Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from
the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all.

**Abstract**: Energy partition between ions and electrons in collisionless shocks has long
been an unsolved fundamental physical problem. We show that kinetic simulations
of moderate Alfv\'enic Mach number, magnetized, collisionless shocks reveal
rapid, faster-than-Coulomb, energy exchange between ions and electrons when the
plasma is sufficiently magnetized. Using kinetic and multi-fluid models with
counter-streaming ions, we identify resonances between electron whistler and
ion magnetohydrodynamic waves that account for this rapid energy exchange.

**Abstract**: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement
learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot
tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized
learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity
and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this
paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile
badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis
locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a
physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In
this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is
used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we
train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue
when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered
badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and
90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized
to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table
tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.

**PDF Url**: [2504.17770v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17770v1)

**Abstract**: The pursuit of ever-shorter time scales is a frontier in modern physics,
exemplified by the synthesis of attosecond light pulses -- an achievement made
possible by coherently superimposing a broad range of photon energies, as
required by the uncertainty principle. However, extending this progress into
the zeptosecond regime poses significant challenges, as it demands
phase-correlated optical spectra spanning hundreds of electronvolts. In this
context, electrons offer a compelling alternative to light because they can be
coherently manipulated to form broad energy superpositions, as demonstrated by
the generation of attosecond pulses in ultrafast electron microscopes. Here, we
propose a practical scheme for compressing free electrons into the zeptosecond
domain by modulating their wave functions using suitably tailored broadband
light fields. Building on recent advances in {free-electron--light--matter}
interactions, our method introduces the concept of temporal lensing -- an
extension of conventional optical lensing to the time domain -- to produce
electron pulses with arbitrarily short durations.


### Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with Anisotropic Quintessence
**Authors**: M. L. Deglmann, B. V. Simão, C. C. Barros Jr

**Published Date**: 2025-04-24

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.17765v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17765v1)

**Abstract**: We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle
in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid
surrounded by a cloud of strings, extending the analysis presented in our
previous work. These novel solutions are dependent on the quintessence state
parameter, $\alpha_{Q}$, and are now valid for a much larger domain of the
radial coordinate. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2,\,1$,
encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. We express the
resulting radial wave functions using the confluent and biconfluent Heun
functions, with special cases represented by Bessel functions. We derive
restrictions on the allowed quantum energy levels by imposing constraints on
the Heun parameters to ensure polynomial solutions. Furthermore, we investigate
the emergence of "dark phases" associated with the radial wave function,
focusing on the interesting case of $\alpha_{Q} = 1$. Our findings provide
insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and
the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.

**Authors**: CMS Collaboration

**Published Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.17755v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17755v1)

**Abstract**: Inclusive and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in
proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV are measured
using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2022, corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of 34.7 fb$^{-1}$. Events with the diphoton final
state are selected, and the measured inclusive fiducial cross section is
$\sigma_\text{fid}$ = 74 $\pm$ 11 (stat) $^{+5}_{-4}$ (syst) fb, in agreement
with the standard model prediction of 67.8 $\pm$ 3.8 fb. Differential cross
sections are measured as functions of several observables: the Higgs boson
transverse momentum and rapidity, the number of associated jets, and the
transverse momentum of the leading jet in the event. Within the uncertainties,
the differential cross sections agree with the standard model predictions.

**Abstract**: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,
rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,
including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous
navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often
resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and
computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing
architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture
for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep
learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:
disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation
of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio
frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast
model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image
classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per
client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This
approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly
connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

**Abstract**: Infrared thermography is a powerful tool for studying liquid-to-vapor phase
change processes. However, its application has been limited in the study of
vapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid
dynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental
difficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to
studying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise
condensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic
two-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and
departure, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and
nanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature
measurements with both spatial (12 $\mu$m) and temporal (5 ms) precision,
leading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using
conventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to
droplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local
condensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local
thermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map
visual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical
parameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional
parameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local
temperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by
developing a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local
thermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.


### Hierarchical memories: Simulating quantum LDPC codes with local gates
**Authors**: Christopher A. Pattison, Anirudh Krishna, John Preskill

**Published Date**: 2023-03-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2303.04798v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04798v2)

**Abstract**: Constant-rate low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are promising candidates
for constructing efficient fault-tolerant quantum memories. However, if
physical gates are subject to geometric-locality constraints, it becomes
challenging to realize these codes. In this paper, we construct a new family of
$[[N,K,D]]$ codes, referred to as hierarchical codes, that encode a number of
logical qubits $K = \Omega(N/\log(N)^2)$. The N-th element of this code family
is obtained by concatenating a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with a surface
code; nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions are sufficient to implement the
corresponding syndrome-extraction circuit and achieve a threshold. Below
threshold the logical failure rate vanishes superpolynomially as a function of
the distance $D(N)$. We present a bilayer architecture for implementing the
syndrome-extraction circuit, and estimate the logical failure rate for this
architecture. Under conservative assumptions, we find that the hierarchical
code outperforms the basic encoding where all logical qubits are encoded in the
surface code.


### Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics
**Authors**: Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn

**Published Date**: 2025-04-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.09698v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09698v2)

**Abstract**: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of
non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion.
Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated
with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by
inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through
quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved
spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical
quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems,
with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process
that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum
dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our
results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as
predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum
systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter
or energy models.


## Diffusion
### Weak-to-Strong Diffusion with Reflection
**Authors**: Lichen Bai, Masashi Sugiyama, Zeke Xie

**Published Date**: 2025-02-01

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2502.00473v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00473v3)

**Abstract**: The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution
with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However,
inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and
architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real
data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel
framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and
strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an
ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that
alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we
theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling
trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly
flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the
strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5,
good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt
adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image,
video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For
example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to
90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD
markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative
improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its
practical utility and deployability.


### polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation
**Authors**: Ayush Jain, Rampi Ramprasad

**Published Date**: 2025-04-24

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.17656v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17656v1)

**Abstract**: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the
energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development
still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics
tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face
significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures
that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative
algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small
molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we
introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to
generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat
unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer
connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855
DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized
molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar
chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark
our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse
conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its
performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given
these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level
structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for
predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for
their intrinsic structural flexibility.


### TarDiff: Target-Oriented Diffusion Guidance for Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series Generation
**Authors**: Bowen Deng, Chang Xu, Hao Li, Yuhao Huang, Min Hou, Jiang Bian

**Published Date**: 2025-04-24

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.17613v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17613v1)

**Abstract**: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial
for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data
scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches
focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal
dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone
does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate,
limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights
the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific
clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose
TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates
task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.
Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff
optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to
improving downstream model performance through influence functions.
Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by
synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion
process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.
Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in
AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only
preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance,
offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare
analytics.


### Simple Graph Contrastive Learning via Fractional-order Neural Diffusion Networks
**Authors**: Yanan Zhao, Feng Ji, Kai Zhao, Xuhao Li, Qiyu Kang, Wenfei Liang, Yahya Alkhatib, Xingchao Jian, Wee Peng Tay

**PDF Url**: [2504.16748v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16748v2)

**Abstract**: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently made progress as an
unsupervised graph representation learning paradigm. GCL approaches can be
categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former
relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that
can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require
negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models.
Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential
Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the
differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us
to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either
local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not
require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and
heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


### Hyper-Transforming Latent Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Ignacio Peis, Batuhan Koyuncu, Isabel Valera, Jes Frellsen

**Published Date**: 2025-04-23

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-24

**PDF Url**: [2504.16580v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16580v2)

**Abstract**: We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into
latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based
hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a
Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables,
addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our
framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing
standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained
either from scratch or via hyper-transforming-a strategy that fine-tunes only
the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient
adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without
requiring full retraining.
