**Abstract**: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in
computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields
due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing
physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through
mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions
within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets
influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational
speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of
parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we
use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to
achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with
automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted
potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP)
model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy
alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed
approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and
can be applied to compress other MLIPs.


### Time, quantum entanglement, and particle decay
**Authors**: J. A. Aguilar-Saavedra

**PDF Url**: [2509.04436v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04436v1)

**Abstract**: We investigate the role of time ordering in entanglement experiments
involving unstable particles, focusing on $\mu^+ \mu^-$ pairs produced in a
maximally-entangled spin state. We analyse the correlations between
measurements performed by two experimenters, Alice (who measures $\mu^-$ spin)
and Bob (who measures $\mu^+$ decay products). Remarkably, the observed
correlations persist irrespective of whether Bob's muon decays before or after
Alice's spin measurement. We further discuss different interpretations of the
same empirical results depending on the observer's reference frame. The
findings reinforce the viewpoint that the Copenhagen interpretation of
measurement is a mathematical tool rather than a literal account of physical
reality.

**Abstract**: Ytterbium-171 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics,
precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is
essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this
reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{171}$Yb
relevant to these applications. We emphasize experimental results and
supplement these with theoretical estimates. We present equations to convert
values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key
parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{171}$Yb

${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}\,$,
${}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,2}\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{S}_1$, and
${}^3\mathrm{P}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{D}_1$). This dataset serves as an
up-to-date reference for studies involving fermionic $^{171}$Yb.

**Published Date**: 2025-04-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2504.04873v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04873v2)

**Abstract**: We consider the problem of traffic density estimation with sparse
measurements from stationary roadside sensors. Our approach uses Fourier neural
operators to learn macroscopic traffic flow dynamics from high-fidelity data.
During inference, the operator functions as an open-loop predictor of traffic
evolution. To close the loop, we couple the open-loop operator with a
correction operator that combines the predicted density with sparse
measurements from the sensors. Simulations with the SUMO software indicate
that, compared to open-loop observers, the proposed closed-loop observer
exhibits classical closed-loop properties such as robustness to noise and
ultimate boundedness of the error. This shows the advantages of combining
learned physics with real-time corrections, and opens avenues for accurate,
efficient, and interpretable data-driven observers.


### On $τ$ Spin Use with KKMCee

**PDF Url**: [2509.04400v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04400v1)

**Abstract**: Spin of $\tau$ represents an interesting phenomenology data point in both its
production from $e^+ e^-$ collision and its subsequent decay. In precision
applications such as Belle-II or FCC, where precision tagging is comparable or
better than $0.1 \%$ Monte Carlo applications are usually necessary.
\texttt{KKMCee}, the precision Monte Carlo program, is assuring such high
precision in a broad energy range. But so far, spin effects were not easy to
grasp. We introduce into \texttt{KKMCee}, \texttt{HepMC3} format output, new
entries, $\tau$ helicity-like information (with weights to evaluate
approximation), and $\tau$ polarimetric vectors to enable weight calculations
to introduce hard interaction additional couplings. The physics details of the
introduced implementations are presented, as well as examples of applications
and ambiguities evaluation. The most recent updates and the useful codes of our
work is provided at

### Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution
**Authors**: Alec L. Riso, Karthik Thyagarajan, Connor Whiting, Katherine Jimenez, Mark Hannum

**Published Date**: 2025-09-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2509.04389v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04389v1)

**Abstract**: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure
communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish
unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the
computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent
properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This
means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of
physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with
unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to
implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using
phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is
to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate
the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational
demonstrations.


### 3HDM with softly broken $Δ(54)$ and $Σ(36)$
**Authors**: Gonçalo Barreto, Ivo de Medeiros Varzielas

**Published Date**: 2025-09-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2509.04369v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04369v1)

**Abstract**: We perform an analysis of the scalar sector of 3-Higgs doublet models with
softly broken $\Delta(54)$ and $\Sigma(36)$ symmetries. We consider the various
vacuum expectation value alignments and consider, for each, softly broken terms
that deviate the alignment. We check the evolution of the minima, present
analytical and numerical results for the lifting of degeneracies of the
physical eigenstates, and describe the decays of the states considering any
residual symmetries.

**Authors**: J. B. Lestz, G. Avdeeva, S. M. Kaye, M. V. Gorelenkova, F. D. Halpern, J. McClenaghan, A. Y. Pankin, K. E. Thome

**Abstract**: The Multi-Mode Model (MMM) for turbulent transport was applied to a large set
of well-analyzed discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX)
in order to evaluate its sensitivities to a wide range of plasma conditions.
MMM calculations were performed for hundreds of milliseconds in each discharge
by performing time-dependent predictive simulations with the 1.5D tokamak
integrated modeling code TRANSP. A closely related study concluded that MMM
predicted electron ($T_e$) and ion ($T_i$) temperature profiles that were in
reasonable agreement with NSTX observations, generally outperforming a
different reduced transport model, TGLF, motivating a more thorough
investigation of the characteristics of the MMM predictions. The simulations
with MMM have electron energy transport dominated by electron temperature
gradient modes for relatively low plasma $\beta$ and high collisionality,
transitioning to a mixture of different modes for higher $\beta$ and lower
collisionality. The thermal ion diffusivity predicted by MMM is much smaller
than the neoclassical contribution, in line with previous experimental analysis
of NSTX. Nonetheless, the $T_e$ and $T_i$ profiles are coupled via collisional
energy exchange and thus sensitive to which transport channels are predicted.
The simulations with MMM are robust to the simulation start time, converging to
remarkably similar temperatures later during the discharge. MMM typically
overpredicts confinement relative to NSTX observations, leading to the
prediction of overly steep profiles. Plasmas with spatially broader $T_e$
profiles, higher $\beta$, and longer energy confinement times tend to be
predicted by MMM with better agreement with the experiment. These findings
provide useful context for understanding the regime-dependent tendencies of MMM
in anticipation of self-consistent, time-dependent predictive simulations of
NSTX-U discharges.


### Assessing time-dependent temperature profile predictions using reduced transport models for high performing NSTX plasmas
**Authors**: J. B. Lestz, G. Avdeeva, T. F. Neiser, M. V. Gorelenkova, F. D. Halpern, S. M. Kaye, J. McClenaghan, A. Y. Pankin, K. E. Thome

**Abstract**: Time-dependent, predictive simulations were performed with the 1.5D tokamak
integrated modeling code TRANSP on a large set of well-analyzed, high
performing discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) in
order to evaluate how well modern reduced transport models can reproduce
experimentally observed temperature profiles in spherical tokamaks. Overall, it
is found that simulations using the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) more consistently
agree with the NSTX observations than those using the Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid
(TGLF) model, despite TGLF requiring orders of magnitude greater computational
cost. When considering all examined discharges, MMM has median overpredictions
of electron temperature ($T_e$) and ion temperature ($T_i$) profiles of 28% and
27%, respectively, relative to the experiment. TGLF overpredicts $T_e$ by 46%,
with much larger variance than MMM, and underpredicts $T_i$ by 25%. As $\beta$
is increased across NSTX discharges, TGLF predicts lower $T_e$ and significant
flattening of the $T_i$ profile, conflicting with NSTX observations. When using
an electrostatic version of TGLF, both $T_e$ and $T_i$ are substantially
overpredicted, underscoring the importance of electromagnetic turbulence in the
high $\beta$ spherical tokamak regime. Additionally, calculations with neural
net surrogate models for TGLF were performed outside of TRANSP with a time
slice flux matching transport solver, finding better agreement with experiment
than the TRANSP simulations, highlighting the impact of different transport
solvers and simulation techniques. Altogether, the reasonable agreement with
experiment of temperature profiles predicted by MMM motivates a more detailed
examination of the sensitivities of the TRANSP simulations with MMM to
different NSTX plasma regimes in a companion paper, in preparation for
self-consistent, time-dependent predictive modeling of NSTX-U scenarios.


### An exploratory calculation of $K_{\rm L}\toμ^+μ^-$ decay from Lattice QCD at physical pion mass
**Authors**: Peter Boyle, En-Hung Chao, Norman Christ, Ceran Hu, Luchang Jin, Yidi Zhao

**PDF Url**: [2509.04346v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04346v1)

**Abstract**: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which
contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice
QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an
inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism.
Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed
diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision
on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a
destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the
decay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The
precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical
contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are
tested and compared.


## Diffusion
### Transition Models: Rethinking the Generative Learning Objective
**Authors**: Zidong Wang, Yiyuan Zhang, Xiaoyu Yue, Xiangyu Yue, Yangguang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai

**Published Date**: 2025-09-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2509.04394v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04394v1)

**Abstract**: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.


### SSGaussian: Semantic-Aware and Structure-Preserving 3D Style Transfer
**Authors**: Jimin Xu, Bosheng Qin, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao, Zhenhui Ye, Jun Yu, Fei Wu

**Published Date**: 2025-09-04

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2509.04379v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04379v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2509.04372v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04372v1)

**Abstract**: In this note, we reflect on several fundamental connections among widely used
post-training techniques. We clarify some intimate connections and equivalences
between reinforcement learning with human feedback, reinforcement learning with
internal feedback, and test-time scaling (particularly soft best-of-$N$
sampling), while also illuminating intrinsic links between diffusion guidance
and test-time scaling. Additionally, we introduce a resampling approach for
alignment and reward-directed diffusion models, sidestepping the need for
explicit reinforcement learning techniques.


### From Editor to Dense Geometry Estimator
**Authors**: JiYuan Wang, Chunyu Lin, Lei Sun, Rongying Liu, Lang Nie, Mingxing Li, Kang Liao, Xiangxiang Chu, Yao Zhao

**Abstract**: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

**Updated Date**: 2025-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2312.03993v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03993v2)

**Abstract**: This project report summarizes our journey to perform stable diffusion
fine-tuning on a dataset containing Calvin and Hobbes comics. The purpose is to
convert any given input image into the comic style of Calvin and Hobbes,
essentially performing style transfer. We train stable-diffusion-v1.5 using Low
Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently speed up the fine-tuning process. The
diffusion itself is handled by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which is a
U-net. Our results were visually appealing for the amount of training time and
the quality of input data that went into training.
