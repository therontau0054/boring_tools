**Abstract**: Attaching enzymes to nanostructures has proven useful to the study of enzyme
functionality under controlled conditions and has led to new technologies.
Often, the utility and interest of enzyme-tethered nanostructures lie in how
the enzymatic activity is affected by how the enzymes are arranged in space.
Therefore, being able to conjugate enzymes to nanostructures while preserving
the enzymatic activity is essential. In this paper, we present a method to
conjugate single-stranded DNA to the enzyme urease while maintaining enzymatic
activity. We show evidence of successful conjugation and quantify the variables
that affect the conjugation yield. We also show that the enzymatic activity is
unchanged after conjugation compared to the enzyme in its native state.
Finally, we demonstrate the tethering of urease to nanostructures made using
DNA origami with high site-specificity. Decorating nanostructures with
enzymatically-active urease may prove to be useful in studying, or even
utilizing, the functionality of urease in disciplines ranging from
biotechnology to soft-matter physics. The techniques we present in this paper
will enable researchers across these fields to modify enzymes without
disrupting their functionality, thus allowing for more insightful studies into
their behavior and utility.

**Abstract**: We investigate the Relativistic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (RGUP)
effects on scalar and fermionic fields using the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation.
Modified equations of motion, Hamiltonians, and stress-energy tensors are
derived in Minkowski spacetime, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections
that ensure a minimal observable length and revert to standard dynamics when
corrections are absent. For fermionic fields in curved spacetime, spin
connections maintain gravitational consistency. This framework, applicable to
high-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates
quantum gravity into relativistic field theories.

**Abstract**: Social network analysis (SNA) has been widely used in physics education
research (PER) in recent years, but mostly in a limited range of the available
modalities. This paper describes a unique approach to egocentric, mixed-methods
SNA applied to qualitative network data obtained from 100 interviews with women
and/or queer professional physicists. We focus on our methods for obtaining
quantitative network data from these qualitative sources and present novel
techniques for analysis of the networks. We also examine the ways in which
egocentric and mixed-methods SNA techniques are aligned with critical methods
and well-suited to the study of difference, non-normativity, and experiences of
marginalization in physics spaces and communities. We explore the limitations
and potential applications of these methods and situate this work in the larger
context of our study of these interviews. This work bridges a methodological
gap between SNA and qualitative work on identity in PER and begins to develop
our understanding of the way gender and sexual minority physicists experience
support.

**Abstract**: The goal of the LHCspin project is to develop innovative solutions for
measuring the 3D structure of nucleons in high-energy polarized fixed-target
collisions at LHC, exploring new processes and exploiting new probes in a
unique, previously unexplored, kinematic regime. A precise multi-dimensional
description of the hadron structure has, in fact, the potential to deepen our
understanding of the strong interactions and to provide a much more precise
framework for measuring both Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model
observables. This ambitious task poses its basis on the recent experience with
the successful installation and operation of the SMOG2 unpolarized gas target
in front of the LHCb spectrometer. Besides allowing for interesting physics
studies ranging from astrophysics to heavy-ion physics, SMOG2 provides an ideal
benchmark for studying beam-target dynamics at the LHC and demonstrates the
feasibility of simultaneous operation with beam-beam collisions. With the
installation of the proposed polarized target system, LHCb will become the
first experiment to simultaneously collect data from unpolarized beam-beam
collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV and polarized and unpolarized beam-target
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\sim$100 GeV. LHCspin has the potential to open new
frontiers in physics by exploiting the capabilities of the world's most
powerful collider and one of the most advanced spectrometers. This document
also highlights the need to perform an R\&D campaign and the commissioning of
the apparatus at the LHC Interaction Region 4 during the Run 4, before its
final installation in LHCb. This opportunity could also allow to undertake
preliminary physics measurements with unprecedented conditions.

**Abstract**: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in
physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we
explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event
detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of
a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more
exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence
level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal
deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole
would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the
measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule
out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.

**Abstract**: Reversing an unknown quantum evolution is of central importance to quantum
information processing and fundamental physics, yet it remains a formidable
challenge as conventional methods necessitate an infinite number of queries to
fully characterize the quantum process. Here we introduce the Quantum Unitary
Reversal Algorithm (QURA), a deterministic and exact approach to universally
reverse arbitrary unknown unitary transformations using $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$
calls of the unitary, where $d$ is the system dimension. Our quantum algorithm
resolves a fundamental problem of time-reversal simulations for closed quantum
systems by confirming the feasibility of reversing any unitary evolution
without knowing the exact process. The algorithm also provides the construction
of a key oracle for unitary inversion in many quantum algorithm frameworks,
such as quantum singular value transformation. It notably reveals a sharp
boundary between the quantum and classical computing realms and unveils a
quadratic quantum advantage in computational complexity for this foundational
task.

**Abstract**: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to
supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these
events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations.
In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for
TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear
stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven
harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the
star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we
transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free
particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to
hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy
distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate
$\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption
process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age
main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.


### Non-Renormalizable SU(5) GUTs: Leptoquark-Induced Neutrino Masses

**PDF Url**: [2504.16022v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16022v1)

**Abstract**: We revisit the doublet-triplet splitting problem within the $SU(5)$ gauge
group framework to advocate a viable regime with the light scalar leptoquark of
the doublet-triplet splitting notoriety that is compatible with the current
experimental bounds on partial proton decay lifetimes. We explicitly
demonstrate, through a consistent use of higher-dimensional operators, how to
implement suppression of baryon number violating interactions of the
aforementioned color triplet. Our study thus offers an alternative approach to
the doublet-triplet splitting problem as it removes a need for an extreme mass
hierarchy between the partners residing in the same representation. We
furthermore pursue two different extensions of two distinct symmetry breaking
scenarios of $SU(5)$, one with a $24$-dimensional representation and the other
one with a $75$-dimensional representation, to produce comparative study of
novel consequences for the gauge coupling unification and the one-loop level
neutrino mass generation. Our results point towards qualitatively novel $SU(5)$
scenarios, where the light scalar leptoquarks, responsible for the neutrino
mass generation, might be even accessible at colliders and thus serve as an
accelerator accessible portal to the high-scale physics.

**Abstract**: Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations share a defining challenge
by requiring a small finite range of spatial separation $z$ between quark/gluon
bilinears for controllable power corrections in the perturbative QCD
factorization, and a large hadron boost $p_z$ for a successful determination of
collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, these two requirements
make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present
the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the
polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance
data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \lesssim 14$, surpassing the
current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed
machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at
$z\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \to \infty$, thereby minimizing
possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful
reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems
with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent
and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^\alpha(1-x)^\beta$ and its
variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data. We propose the use of
generative machine learning algorithms to mitigate these issues and present our
determination of the polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs in the nucleon.


### Probing New Physics Through CP Violation in $B_{(s)}\to Vμ^+μ^-$ Decays

**PDF Url**: [2504.16014v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16014v1)

**Abstract**: Rare decays of the kind $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B_s\to \phi\mu^+\mu^-$ are
key players for testing the Standard Model. The current experimental data for
their decay rates and angular observables show tensions with the theoretical
predictions that may be indications of New Physics. We present a strategy to
extract the relevant short-distance coefficients in the presence of new sources
of CP violation, utilizing a synergy with $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. Using the
current data as a guideline, we illustrate the new method to determine the
complex coefficients $C_9^{(\prime)}$ and $C_{10}^{(\prime)}$ using only four
angular observables. Interestingly, the current experimental picture leaves
significant room for CP-violating New Physics. We discuss also the link to
leptonic $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. We are looking forward to the
implementation of these strategies at the future high-precision frontier of
flavour physics.

**PDF Url**: [2504.15942v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15942v1)

**Abstract**: AI-based systems, such as Google's GenCast, have recently redefined the state
of the art in weather forecasting, offering more accurate and timely
predictions of both everyday weather and extreme events. While these systems
are on the verge of replacing traditional meteorological methods, they also
introduce new vulnerabilities into the forecasting process. In this paper, we
investigate this threat and present a novel attack on autoregressive diffusion
models, such as those used in GenCast, capable of manipulating weather
forecasts and fabricating extreme events, including hurricanes, heat waves, and
intense rainfall. The attack introduces subtle perturbations into weather
observations that are statistically indistinguishable from natural noise and
change less than 0.1% of the measurements - comparable to tampering with data
from a single meteorological satellite. As modern forecasting integrates data
from nearly a hundred satellites and many other sources operated by different
countries, our findings highlight a critical security risk with the potential
to cause large-scale disruptions and undermine public trust in weather
prediction.

**Abstract**: This paper explores leveraging the Clifford algebra's expressive power for
$\E(n)$-equivariant diffusion models. We utilize the geometric products between
Clifford multivectors and the rich geometric information encoded in Clifford
subspaces in \emph{Clifford Diffusion Models} (CDMs). We extend the diffusion
process beyond just Clifford one-vectors to incorporate all higher-grade
multivector subspaces. The data is embedded in grade-$k$ subspaces, allowing us
to apply latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This enables CDMs to
capture the joint distribution across different subspaces of the algebra,
incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. We
provide empirical results for unconditional molecular generation on the QM9
dataset, showing that CDMs provide a promising avenue for generative modeling.


### Markov Kernels, Distances and Optimal Control: A Parable of Linear Quadratic Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering

**Abstract**: For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair
$(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive
semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the It\^{o} diffusion
${\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}_t {\mathrm{d}}
t + \sqrt{2}\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an
accompanying killing of probability mass at rate
$\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov
kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear
reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result
generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case
$\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t\right)=\left(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{I}\right)$,
and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence
of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian Schr\"{o}dinger bridge
is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV
diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed
deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using
dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation
for the
$\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t,\boldsymbol{Q}_t\right)$-parametrized
kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent
distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal
control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as
generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited
success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new
connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This
connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the
linear quadratic Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.


### On the Guidance of Flow Matching

**Abstract**: Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative
tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided
generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general
than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion
models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general
guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance
techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new
training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for
training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover
classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically
investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing
suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets,
image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of
our flow matching guidance framework. Code to reproduce the experiments can be
found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/flow_guidance.
