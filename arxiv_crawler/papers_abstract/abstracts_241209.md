**Abstract**: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and
molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a
wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and
metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very
recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without
demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits
with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding
challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and
metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction.
Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over
6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing
state-of-the-art performance for several critical metrics that underpin the
success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of
atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for
hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping
lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling
record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging
fidelity of over 99.99%. We lay out a detailed, near-term plan to enable
zone-based quantum computing with $\sim$6,000 atoms, and demonstrate a crucial
ingredient thereof: coherent moves of up to 610 $\mu$m with a fidelity of
$\sim$99.95%, as characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our
results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal
quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term
prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and
metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning
capabilities at a similar scale.

**Abstract**: We obtain the Hawking spectrum by exponentiating a series of Feynman diagrams
describing a scalar field scattering through a collapse background. Our
approach is rooted in semiclassical methods of scattering amplitudes which have
recently been developed for application to gravitational-wave physics. The
diagrams we encounter do not compute a standard amplitude, but rather an in-in
generalisation of an amplitude which is closely connected to the Bogoliubov
coefficients. We also compute the subdominant one-loop correction in our
perturbative approach, analogous to the triangle correction to Schwarzschild
scattering. This term can be interpreted as a finite-size correction sensitive
to the radius of the black hole.

**Abstract**: Convection-driven flows in planetary interiors exhibit rich dynamics owing to
multiple spatio-temporally varying forcing conditions and physical constraints.
In particular, the churning of liquid metals in the Earth's outer core,
responsible for the dynamic geomagnetic field, is subjected to lower mantle
thermal heterogeneity. Besides, the plausible existence of a stable
stratification layer below the mantle influences the columnar convection. These
additional symmetry-breaking constraints, motivated from geophysical scenario
of the Earth's thermal core--mantle interaction, modulate the otherwise
periodic and axially invariant convection flow patterns. Thus, the present
study focuses on qualitative characterization and parametric quantification of
rotating penetrative convection in the presence of magnetic induction effects
with an aim to understand the role of the lower mantle on core convection
thermally. Using complementing computational and theoretical calculations, the
present study estimates the depth of penetration in bounded and unbounded fluid
domains. Apart from qualitative differences in convective flow patterns from
the reference homogeneous configurations, the additional constraints spatially
modulate the extent of penetration into stable regions. Confinement effects,
adding to the damping of penetrative convection, arising out of boundary
constraints are quantified for bounded geometry. Appropriate normalizations,
implemented to eliminate such effects, result in amended penetration depth
estimates that align with the qualitative characteristics obtained for
unbounded domains. Exact closed-form expressions for the depth of penetration
are obtained, providing insights into the role of individual contributions of
multiple physical constraints. Implications are speculated for realistic, yet
unreachable, regimes of geophysical conditions of planetary cores.


### Physics-informed reduced order model with conditional neural fields
**Authors**: Minji Kim, Tianshu Wen, Kookjin Lee, Youngsoo Choi

**Published Date**: 2024-12-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2412.05233v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05233v1)

**Abstract**: This study presents the conditional neural fields for reduced-order modeling
(CNF-ROM) framework to approximate solutions of parametrized partial
differential equations (PDEs). The approach combines a parametric neural ODE
(PNODE) for modeling latent dynamics over time with a decoder that reconstructs
PDE solutions from the corresponding latent states. We introduce a
physics-informed learning objective for CNF-ROM, which includes two key
components. First, the framework uses coordinate-based neural networks to
calculate and minimize PDE residuals by computing spatial derivatives via
automatic differentiation and applying the chain rule for time derivatives.
Second, exact initial and boundary conditions (IC/BC) are imposed using
approximate distance functions (ADFs) [Sukumar and Srivastava, CMAME, 2022].
However, ADFs introduce a trade-off as their second- or higher-order
derivatives become unstable at the joining points of boundaries. To address
this, we introduce an auxiliary network inspired by [Gladstone et al., NeurIPS
ML4PS workshop, 2022]. Our method is validated through parameter extrapolation
and interpolation, temporal extrapolation, and comparisons with analytical
solutions.

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2412.05227v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05227v1)

**Abstract**: Some calculations of parton distributions from first principles only give
access to a limited range of Fourier modes of the function to reconstruct. We
present a physically motivated procedure to regularize the inverse integral
problem using a Gaussian process as a Bayesian prior. We propose to fix the
hyperparameters of the prior in a meaningful physical fashion, offering a
simple implementation, great numerical efficiency, and allowing us to
understand and keep control easily of the uncertainty of the reconstruction.


### Interplay of intrinsic motion of partons and soft gluon emissions in Drell-Yan production studied with PYTHIA

**Abstract**: Understanding the intrinsic transverse momentum (intrinsic-$k_T$) of partons
within colliding hadrons, typically modeled with a Gaussian distribution
characterized by a specific width (the intrinsic-$k_T$ width), has been an
extremely challenging issue. This difficulty arises because event generators
like Pythia require an intrinsic-$k_T$ width that unexpectedly varies with
collision energy, reaching unphysical values at high energies. This paper
investigates the underlying physics behind this energy dependence in Pythia,
revealing that it arises from an interplay between two non-perturbative
processes: the internal transverse motion of partons and non-perturbative soft
gluon emissions. These contributions are most constrained in the production of
Drell-Yan pairs with very low transverse momentum, where soft gluon effects
become increasingly prominent with rising collision energy-contrary to initial
expectations. Through a detailed analysis of the non-perturbative Sudakov form
factor and its influence on intrinsic-$k_T$ width, we clarify the observed
energy scaling behavior in Pythia, providing insight into a longstanding issue
in parton shower modeling.


### Inflation in a scalar-vector gravity theory
**Authors**: Manuel Gonzalez-Espinoza, Ramon Herrera

**Published Date**: 2024-05-23

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2405.14653v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14653v2)

**Abstract**: We study the possibility that inflation is driven by a scalar field together
with a vector field minimally coupled to gravity. By assuming an effective
potential that incorporates both fields into the action, we explore two
distinct scenarios: one where the fields interact and another where they do
not. In this context, we find different analytical solutions to the background
scalar-vector fields dynamics during the inflationary scenario considering the
slow-roll approximation. Besides, general conditions required for these models
of two fields to be realizable are determined and discussed. From the
cosmological perturbations, we consider a local field rotation, and then we
determine these perturbations (scalar and tensor) during inflation, and we also
utilize recent cosmological observations for constraining the parameter-space
in these scalar-vector inflationary models.


### Variational Encoder-Decoders for Learning Latent Representations of Physical Systems
**Authors**: Subashree Venkatasubramanian, David A. Barajas-Solano

**Published Date**: 2024-12-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2412.05175v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05175v1)

**Abstract**: We present a deep-learning Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) framework for
learning data-driven low-dimensional representations of the relationship
between high-dimensional parameters of a physical system and the system's
high-dimensional observable response. The framework consists of two deep
learning-based probabilistic transformations: An encoder mapping parameters to
latent codes and a decoder mapping latent codes to the observable response. The
hyperparameters of these transformations are identified by maximizing a
variational lower bound on the log-conditional distribution of the observable
response given parameters. To promote the disentanglement of latent codes, we
equip this variational loss with a penalty on the off-diagonal entries of the
aggregate distribution covariance of codes. This regularization penalty
encourages the pushforward of a standard Gaussian distribution of latent codes
to approximate the marginal distribution of the observable response.
  Using the proposed framework we successfully model the hydraulic pressure
response at observation wells of a groundwater flow model as a function of its
discrete log-hydraulic transmissivity field. Compared to the canonical
correlation analysis encoding, the VED model achieves a lower-dimensional
latent representation, with as low as $r = 50$ latent dimensions without a
significant loss of reconstruction accuracy. We explore the impact of
regularization on model performance, finding that KL-divergence and covariance
regularization improve feature disentanglement in latent space while
maintaining reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, we evaluate the generative
capabilities of the regularized model by decoding random Gaussian noise,
revealing that tuning both $\beta$ and $\lambda$ parameters enhances the
quality of the generated observable response data.


### Fast Laplace transforms on quantum computers
**Authors**: Julien Zylberman

**Published Date**: 2024-12-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2412.05173v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05173v1)

**Abstract**: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained
an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on
quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform
(QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace
transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In
many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$
as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring
exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time
than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the
possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace
transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry,
machine learning, and finance.

**PDF Url**: [2412.05170v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05170v1)

**Abstract**: We numerically study the optimal control of an atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate in an optical lattice. We present two generalizations of the
gradient-based algorithm, GRAPE, in the non-linear case and for a
two-dimensional lattice. We show how to construct such algorithms from
Pontryagin's maximum principle. A wide variety of target states can be achieved
with high precision by varying only the laser phases setting the lattice
position. We discuss the physical relevance of the different results and the
future directions of this work.


## Diffusion
### MotionFlow: Attention-Driven Motion Transfer in Video Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tuna Han Salih Meral, Hidir Yesiltepe, Connor Dunlop, Pinar Yanardag

**Published Date**: 2024-12-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2412.05275v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05275v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-video models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in producing
diverse and captivating video content, showcasing a notable advancement in
generative AI. However, these models generally lack fine-grained control over
motion patterns, limiting their practical applicability. We introduce
MotionFlow, a novel framework designed for motion transfer in video diffusion
models. Our method utilizes cross-attention maps to accurately capture and
manipulate spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling seamless motion transfers
across various contexts. Our approach does not require training and works on
test-time by leveraging the inherent capabilities of pre-trained video
diffusion models. In contrast to traditional approaches, which struggle with
comprehensive scene changes while maintaining consistent motion, MotionFlow
successfully handles such complex transformations through its attention-based
mechanism. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
MotionFlow significantly outperforms existing models in both fidelity and
versatility even during drastic scene alterations.


### Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis Benchmark
**Authors**: Xiangyu Han, Zhen Jia, Boyi Li, Yan Wang, Boris Ivanovic, Yurong You, Lingjie Liu, Yue Wang, Marco Pavone, Chen Feng, Yiming Li

**PDF Url**: [2412.05256v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05256v1)

**Abstract**: Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of
vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis
(NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to
accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances
in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic
rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale
driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an
interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast,
extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains
underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To
address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple
traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first
Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct
quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting
methods across different difficulty levels. Our results show that Gaussian
Splatting is prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating
diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under
large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and
large-scale training. We have released our data to help advance self-driving
and urban robotics simulation technology.


### PAC Privacy Preserving Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Qipan Xu, Youlong Ding, Xinxi Zhang, Jie Gao, Hao Wang

**Published Date**: 2023-12-02

**PDF Url**: [2312.01201v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01201v5)

**Abstract**: Data privacy protection is garnering increased attention among researchers.
Diffusion models (DMs), particularly with strict differential privacy, can
potentially produce images with both high privacy and visual quality. However,
challenges arise such as in ensuring robust protection in privatizing specific
data attributes, areas where current models often fall short. To address these
challenges, we introduce the PAC Privacy Preserving Diffusion Model, a model
leverages diffusion principles and ensure Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)
privacy. We enhance privacy protection by integrating a private classifier
guidance into the Langevin Sampling Process. Additionally, recognizing the gap
in measuring the privacy of models, we have developed a novel metric to gauge
privacy levels. Our model, assessed with this new metric and supported by
Gaussian matrix computations for the PAC bound, has shown superior performance
in privacy protection over existing leading private generative models according
to benchmark tests.


### DNF: Unconditional 4D Generation with Dictionary-based Neural Fields
**Authors**: Xinyi Zhang, Naiqi Li, Angela Dai

**Published Date**: 2024-12-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-06

**PDF Url**: [2412.05161v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05161v1)

**Abstract**: While remarkable success has been achieved through diffusion-based 3D
generative models for shapes, 4D generative modeling remains challenging due to
the complexity of object deformations over time. We propose DNF, a new 4D
representation for unconditional generative modeling that efficiently models
deformable shapes with disentangled shape and motion while capturing
high-fidelity details in the deforming objects. To achieve this, we propose a
dictionary learning approach to disentangle 4D motion from shape as neural
fields. Both shape and motion are represented as learned latent spaces, where
each deformable shape is represented by its shape and motion global latent
codes, shape-specific coefficient vectors, and shared dictionary information.
This captures both shape-specific detail and global shared information in the
learned dictionary. Our dictionary-based representation well balances fidelity,
contiguity and compression -- combined with a transformer-based diffusion
model, our method is able to generate effective, high-fidelity 4D animations.


### The Score-Difference Flow for Implicit Generative Modeling
**Authors**: Romann M. Weber

**Abstract**: Implicit generative modeling (IGM) aims to produce samples of synthetic data
matching the characteristics of a target data distribution. Recent work (e.g.
score-matching networks, diffusion models) has approached the IGM problem from
the perspective of pushing synthetic source data toward the target distribution
via dynamical perturbations or flows in the ambient space. In this direction,
we present the score difference (SD) between arbitrary target and source
distributions as a flow that optimally reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between them. We apply the SD flow to convenient proxy distributions, which are
aligned if and only if the original distributions are aligned. We demonstrate
the formal equivalence of this formulation to denoising diffusion models under
certain conditions. We also show that the training of generative adversarial
networks includes a hidden data-optimization sub-problem, which induces the SD
flow under certain choices of loss function when the discriminator is optimal.
As a result, the SD flow provides a theoretical link between model classes that
individually address the three challenges of the "generative modeling trilemma"
-- high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast sampling -- thereby setting the
stage for a unified approach.
