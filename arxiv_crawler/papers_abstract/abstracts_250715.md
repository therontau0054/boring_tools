**Abstract**: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics
Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial
autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is
software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++
expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark
contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled
modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework
designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that
allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using
state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)
while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.
A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked
publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure
real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,
SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with
native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from
manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless
hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of
mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices
under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates
research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

**Abstract**: We analyse the transitions between established phases of the El Ni\~no
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by surveying the daily data of the Southern
Oscillation Index from an entropic viewpoint using the framework of stochastic
Statistical Physics. We evaluate the variation of entropy produced due to each
recorded path of that index during each transition as well as taking only into
consideration the beginning and the end of the change between phases and
verified both integral fluctuation relations. The statistical results show that
these entropy variations have not been extreme entropic events; only the
transition between the strong $1999-2000$ La Ni\~na to the moderate $2002-2003$
El Ni\~no is at the edge of being so. With that, the present work opens a long
and winding avenue of research over the application of stochastic Statistical
Physics to Climate Dynamics.

**PDF Url**: [2507.10505v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10505v1)

**Abstract**: We investigate the $\Xi^*$ resonances within the molecular picture, where
these states are dynamically generated as poles in the unitarized scattering
amplitudes arising from the coupled-channel interactions of $K^{*-} \Lambda$,
$K^{*-} \Sigma^0$, $\rho^- \Xi^0$, $\overline{K}{}^{*0} \Sigma^-$, $\rho^0
\Xi^-$, $\omega \Xi^-$, and $\phi \Xi^-$. The interaction kernel is derived
from the local hidden gauge formalism, while the unitarization procedure
employs a hybrid method that combines cutoff and dimensional regularizations in
the evaluation of the loop function. From a detailed spectroscopic analysis, we
identify two $S = -2$ baryon states whose properties are compatible with some
of the $\Xi^*$ resonances listed in the Review of Particle Physics. To explore
their possible experimental signatures, we compute the femtoscopic correlation
functions for all the vector-baryon pairs considered in the present study,
using realistic estimates of production weights and varying source sizes $R =
1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5$ fm.

**Abstract**: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics,
precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is
essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this
reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr
relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and
supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert
values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key
parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0
\rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \,
^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \,
^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies
involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-14

**PDF Url**: [2507.10462v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10462v1)

**Abstract**: We present a machine learning model for predicting the electric dipole moment
of diatomic molecules using only the atomic properties of the constituent
atoms. Our model can screen the entire periodic table and identify the
molecules with the largest dipole moment for applications in cold molecular
sciences, or find the molecule with the largest dipole moment that contains a
given atom. Similarly, our model identifies useful trends that explain the
dipole moment of molecules, improving our intuition in chemical physics.
Finally, we condense our model into an analytical expression to predict the
dipole moment in terms of atomic properties.

**Abstract**: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize
nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the
shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We conclude that, on the
whole, the discussion regarding low-energy nuclear physics is confusing and the
suggested impact on nuclear structure research is overstated. Conversely,
efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis
pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used
to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy ion experiments.

**PDF Url**: [2504.18852v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18852v4)

**Abstract**: We derive the exact analytic form of the potential experienced by a magnetic
dipole trapped between two infinite parallel superconducting plates using the
method of image dipoles, providing a benchmark for numerical methods and a
foundation for studying the stability and dynamics of magnetically levitated
systems in precision measurements and fundamental physics experiments.


### On physical consistency of HLL-type Riemann solvers for ideal MHD
**Authors**: Fan Zhang, Andrea Lani, Stefaan Poedts

**PDF Url**: [2507.10420v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10420v1)

**Abstract**: Approximate Riemann solvers are widely used for solving hyperbolic
conservation laws, including those of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, due
to the nonlinearity and complexity of MHD, obtaining accurate and robust
numerical solutions to MHD equations is non-trivial, and it may be challenging
for an approximate MHD Riemann solver to preserve the positivity of scalar
variables, particularly when the plasma beta is low. As we have identified that
the inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and
magnetic energy may be responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar
variables, we propose a physical consistency condition and implement it in
HLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thus alleviating the erroneous magnetic field
solutions breaking scalar positivity. In addition, (I) for the HLLC-type
scheme, we have designed a revised two-state approximation, specifically
reducing numerical error in magnetic field solutions, and (II) for the
HLLD-type scheme, we replace the constant total pressure assumption by a
three-state assumption for the intermediate thermal energy, which is more
consistent with our other assumptions. The proposed schemes perform better in
numerical examples with low plasma \b{eta}. Moreover, we explained the energy
error introduced during time integration.


### Polaritonic Machine Learning for Graph-based Data Analysis
**Authors**: Yuan Wang, Stefano Scali, Oleksandr Kyriienko

**Published Date**: 2025-07-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-14

**PDF Url**: [2507.10415v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10415v1)

**Abstract**: Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for
accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a
computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit
features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address
problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3)
integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we
propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data
problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed
relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This
information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved
learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive
benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy
for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial
improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a
distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering,
while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.


### BayesSDF: Surface-Based Laplacian Uncertainty Estimation for 3D Geometry with Neural Signed Distance Fields
**Authors**: Rushil Desai

**Published Date**: 2025-07-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-14

**PDF Url**: [2507.06269v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06269v2)

**Abstract**: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and reliable uncertainty estimates are
essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, Signed
Distance Functions (SDFs) define continuous and differentiable geometry, making
them better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a
Laplace approximation to quantify local surface instability using Hessian-based
metrics, enabling efficient, surfaceaware uncertainty estimation. Our method
shows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed
geometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use.
Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric
consistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene
reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.


## Diffusion
### Can You Detect the Difference?
**Authors**: İsmail Tarım, Aytuğ Onan

**Published Date**: 2025-07-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-14

**PDF Url**: [2507.10475v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10475v1)

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.


### Parallel Sampling of Diffusion Models on $SO(3)$
**Authors**: Yan-Ting Chen, Hao-Wei Chen, Tsu-Ching Hsiao, Chun-Yi Lee

**Published Date**: 2025-07-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-14

**PDF Url**: [2507.10347v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10347v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we design an algorithm to accelerate the diffusion process on
the $SO(3)$ manifold. The inherently sequential nature of diffusion models
necessitates substantial time for denoising perturbed data. To overcome this
limitation, we proposed to adapt the numerical Picard iteration for the $SO(3)$
space. We demonstrate our algorithm on an existing method that employs
diffusion models to address the pose ambiguity problem. Moreover, we show that
this acceleration advantage occurs without any measurable degradation in task
reward. The experiments reveal that our algorithm achieves a speed-up of up to
4.9$\times$, significantly reducing the latency for generating a single sample.


### Zero-Shot Cyclic Peptide Design via Composable Geometric Constraints
**Authors**: Dapeng Jiang, Xiangzhe Kong, Jiaqi Han, Mingyu Li, Rui Jiao, Wenbing Huang, Stefano Ermon, Jianzhu Ma, Yang Liu

**Published Date**: 2025-07-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-14

**PDF Url**: [2507.04225v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04225v2)

**Abstract**: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.


## Quantitative Finance
### Tensor train representations of Greeks for Fourier-based pricing of multi-asset options
**Authors**: Rihito Sakurai, Koichi Miyamoto, Tsuyoshi Okubo

**Published Date**: 2025-07-11

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-11

**PDF Url**: [2507.08482v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08482v1)

**Abstract**: Efficient computation of Greeks for multi-asset options remains a key
challenge in quantitative finance. While Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is widely
used, it suffers from the large sample complexity for high accuracy. We propose
a framework to compute Greeks in a single evaluation of a tensor train (TT),
which is obtained by compressing the Fourier transform (FT)-based pricing
function via TT learning using tensor cross interpolation. Based on this TT
representation, we introduce two approaches to compute Greeks: a numerical
differentiation (ND) approach that applies a numerical differential operator to
one tensor core and an analytical (AN) approach that constructs the TT of
closed-form differentiation expressions of FT-based pricing. Numerical
experiments on a five-asset min-call option in the Black-Sholes model show
significant speed-ups of up to about $10^{5} \times$ over MC while maintaining
comparable accuracy. The ND approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of the AN
approach and requires lower computational complexity for constructing the TT
representation, making it the preferred choice.
