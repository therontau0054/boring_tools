**Abstract**: The high-temperature plasma in the solar interior generates stochastic
gravitational waves (GWs). Due to its significance as the primary source of
high-frequency GWs in the solar system, we reexamine this phenomenon
highlighting some physical processes, including the contribution of macroscopic
hydrodynamic fluctuations. Our analysis builds upon several studies of axion
emission from the Sun, particularly in relation to the treatment of plasma
effects. The resulting GW spectrum is comparable to many well-motivated early
Universe signals, yet orders of magnitude below the current sensitivities of
axion helioscopes such as (Baby)IAXO.

**Abstract**: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure
and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models
operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical
findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the
importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for
future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task
agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and
reasoning behaviors, are available at:

**Authors**: Dengke Qu, Quan Lin, Lei Xiao, Xiang Zhan, Peng Xue

**Abstract**: Understanding the physical world fundamentally relies on the assumption that
events are temporally ordered, with past events serving as causes for future
ones. However, quantum mechanics permits events to occur in a superposition of
causal orders, providing new types of quantum resources for quantum information
tasks. Previous demonstrations of indefinite causal order have relied on a
process known as quantum switch and depended on specific assumptions about the
devices used in the laboratory. Recently, a theoretical scheme for the
certification of indefinite causal order in the quantum switch has been
obtained solely from the output statistics of the devices, analogous to the
device-independent proofs of nonlocality through violations of the Bell
inequality. Here, we report an experimental verification of the causal
inequality using spacelike-separated entangled photons, where one photon
functions as the control qubit in a quantum switch and the other serves as an
additional observer. Through local measurement statistics, we observe a
violation of the causal inequality by 24 standard deviations. This work
provides evidence for a device-independent certification of indefinite causal
order, relying solely on observed correlations without requiring device
characterization. Our results pave the way toward a complete understanding of
indefinite causal order and its potential applications in quantum information
processing.

**PDF Url**: [2508.04628v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04628v1)

**Abstract**: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that
underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and
chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified
approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically
incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a
long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density
functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an
auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized
Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary
conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their
influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics.
In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the
Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity
under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical
role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning
framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse
electrostatic environments.


### Optimizing quantum transport via the quantum Doob transform
**Authors**: Dolores Esteve, Carlos Pérez-Espigares, Ricardo Gutiérrez, Daniel Manzano

**PDF Url**: [2508.04622v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04622v1)

**Abstract**: Quantum transport plays a central role in both fundamental physics and the
development of quantum technologies. While significant progress has been made
in understanding transport phenomena in quantum systems, methods for optimizing
transport properties remain limited, particularly in complex quantum networks.
Building on recent advances in classical network optimization via the
generalized Doob transform, we introduce a novel method that extends this
approach to quantum networks. Our framework leverages a single diagonalization
of the system generator to efficiently tailor both the Hamiltonian and
dissipative contributions, optimizing transport observables such as currents
and activities. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through extensive
numerical explorations, showing that optimal performance arises from
non-trivial modifications to both coherent and incoherent dynamics. We also
assess the robustness of the optimization under constraints that preserve
specific physical features, such as fixed dissipative structures and
input-output interactions. Finally, we discuss the connection between optimized
transport and centrosymmetry, highlighting the relevance of this property for
enhanced transport efficiency in quantum systems.

**PDF Url**: [2508.04620v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04620v1)

**Abstract**: Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of
twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire
material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a
desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally
elucidate the interesting physics of moir\'e materials coupled to light.
Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting
band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a
topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting
phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic
waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible
untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.


### Physics-Informed Neural Network for Elastic Wave-Mode Separation
**Authors**: E. A. B. Alves, P. D. S. de Lima, D. H. G. Duarte, M. S. Ferreira, J. M. de Araújo, C. G. Bezerra

**Abstract**: Mode conversion in non-homogeneous elastic media makes it challenging to
interpret physical properties accurately. Decomposing these modes correctly is
crucial across various scientific areas. Recent machine learning approaches
have been proposed to address this problem, utilizing the Helmholtz
decomposition technique. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of a
physics-informed neural network (PINN) in separating P and S modes by solving a
scalar Poisson equation. This scalar formulation offers a dimensionally
scalable reduction in computational cost compared to the traditional vector
formulation. We verify the proposed method in both homogeneous and realistic
non-homogeneous elastic models as showcases. The obtained separated modes
closely match those from conventional numerical techniques, while exhibiting
reduced transverse wave leakage.

**Abstract**: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white
in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality
metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential
for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were
investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from
experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in
aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data
into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we
introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic
displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in
function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a
custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to
counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we
introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via
a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure
physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model
was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining
computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training
strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one
dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The
two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within
the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from
steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based
quality control in industrial applications.

**Abstract**: Extended two-dimensional (2D) crystals of dye molecules adsorbed on 2D
material substrates like boron nitride have recently become a subject of
intense study, with potential applications ranging from quantum technology to
optoelectronics. The most established technique for the production of these
films is physical vapor transport in vacuum. We demonstrate that few-layer
crystalline films of the organic dye molecule PTCDI on boron nitride can be
produced by microspacing in-air sublimation, a radically simplified technique,
not requiring complicated vacuum systems. The resulting layers display clearly
resolved atomic step terraces in atomic force microscopy, and a clear
polarization anisotropy in their fluorescence, confirming molecular alignment
and long-range order. Using density functional theory and classical molecular
dynamics simulations, the canted motive is identified as the most likely
building block for the morphology of a PTDCI monolayer on the hBN substrate.


### Algebraically Observable Physics-Informed Neural Network and its Application to Epidemiological Modelling
**Authors**: Mizuka Komatsu

**Published Date**: 2025-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2508.04590v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04590v1)

**Abstract**: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that
integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In
this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and
parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential
equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to
the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate
the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial
measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state
variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on
algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is
demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context
of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial
measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the
proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods.
The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such
as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed
from the measurements.


## Diffusion
### HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Young D. Kwon, Rui Li, Sijia Li, Da Li, Sourav Bhattacharya, Stylianos I. Venieris

**PDF Url**: [2508.04663v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04663v1)

**Abstract**: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.


### Multitask Learning with Stochastic Interpolants
**Authors**: Hugo Negrel, Florentin Coeurdoux, Michael S. Albergo, Eric Vanden-Eijnden

**Published Date**: 2025-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2508.04605v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04605v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions
that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To
enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time
variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge
probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach
enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling
multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants
not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative
models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and
inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling,
suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized
models.


### From Split to Share: Private Inference with Distributed Feature Sharing
**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Jiayi Wen, Shouhong Tan, Zhirun Zheng, Cheng Huang

**Published Date**: 2025-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2508.04346v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04346v1)

**Abstract**: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.


### Quasi-Clique Discovery via Energy Diffusion
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Yilong Luo, Mingyuan Ma, Yao Chen, Enqiang Zhu, Jin Xu, Chanjuan Liu

**Published Date**: 2025-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2508.04174v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04174v1)

**Abstract**: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs with edge density no less than a given
threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining, with broad applications in
social networks, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Existing heuristics often rely
on greedy rules, similarity measures, or metaheuristic search, but struggle to
maintain both efficiency and solution consistency across diverse graphs. This
paper introduces EDQC, a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm inspired by
energy diffusion. Instead of explicitly enumerating candidate subgraphs, EDQC
performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices, naturally
concentrating energy within structurally cohesive regions. The approach enables
efficient dense subgraph discovery without exhaustive search or
dataset-specific tuning. Experimental results on 30 real-world datasets
demonstrate that EDQC consistently discovers larger quasi-cliques than
state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of datasets, while also yielding
lower variance in solution quality. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the
first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.


### UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields
**Authors**: Fabian Perez, Sara Rojas, Carlos Hinojosa, Hoover Rueda-Chacón, Bernard Ghanem

**Published Date**: 2025-06-27

**PDF Url**: [2506.21884v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21884v2)

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

## Quantitative Finance
### CTBench: Cryptocurrency Time Series Generation Benchmark
**Authors**: Yihao Ang, Qiang Wang, Qiang Huang, Yifan Bao, Xinyu Xi, Anthony K. H. Tung, Chen Jin, Zhiyong Huang

**Published Date**: 2025-08-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-08-03

**PDF Url**: [2508.02758v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02758v1)

**Abstract**: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress
testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in
cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and
rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and
benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work
(1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses
narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific
complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for
trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the
first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain.
\textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates
TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy,
rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational
efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the
\emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves
temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the
\emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support
mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models
from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering
trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably,
\textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for
selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy
development.
