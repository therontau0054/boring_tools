**Abstract**: In this article, we examine the validity range of the Effective Field Theory
(EFT) description of high-energy Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. To this
purpose, we consider explicit mediators that contribute to these processes in
the $s$- and $t$-channels, comparing their effects in Drell-Yan distributions
with the ones obtained by matching onto the corresponding EFT. We determine the
conditions for the EFT results to accurately describe these scenarios. In
particular, we explore the impact of including dimension-eight $(d=8)$
operators in the faster convergence of the EFT series, at the analytical and
numerical level, considering contributions to the cross section up to the
square of $d=8$ EFT operator insertions. Moreover, we discuss the possible
implications of clipping LHC data and illustrate results for a specific
New-Physics scenario motivated by low-energy flavor data.

**Abstract**: We investigate two-neutrino double beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) in chiral
effective field theory. We find contributions from weak magnetism and
double-weak pion-exchange at next-to-leading-order in the chiral power
counting. We discuss the impact of the chiral corrections on the electron
spectra and find that they should be included in analyses of $2\nu\beta\beta$
decay that aim to uncover new physics signatures in the electron spectrum. We
illustrate this point by revisiting the effect of sterile neutrinos and
non-standard charged interactions. We also find that the pion-exchange
contributions involve nuclear matrix elements that are related to those
appearing in neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$). We
investigate whether the $0\nu \beta \beta$ nuclear matrix elements can be
obtained from detailed measurements of the energy spectrum of the outgoing
electrons in $2\nu\beta\beta$ transitions.

**Abstract**: The FAIR Universe -- HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focuses on measuring the
physics properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators due to
differences in modelling systematic errors. Additionally, the challenge is
leveraging a large-compute-scale AI platform for sharing datasets, training
models, and hosting machine learning competitions. Our challenge brings
together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our
understanding and methodologies in handling systematic (epistemic)
uncertainties within AI techniques.


### $B_c \to η_c$ form factors at large recoil: Interplay of soft-quark and soft-gluon dynamics
**Authors**: Guido Bell, Philipp Böer, Thorsten Feldmann, Dennis Horstmann, Vladyslav Shtabovenko

**Published Date**: 2024-12-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-18

**PDF Url**: [2412.14149v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14149v1)

**Abstract**: We perform an all-order analysis of double-logarithmic corrections to the
so-called soft-overlap contribution to heavy-to-light transition form factors
at large hadronic recoil. Specifically, we study $B_c \to \eta_c$ transitions
within a perturbative non-relativistic framework, treating both the bottom and
charm quarks as heavy with the hierarchy $m_b \gg m_c \gg\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.
Our diagrammatic analysis shows that double-logarithmic corrections arise from
two distinct sources: Exponentiated soft-gluon effects described by standard
Sudakov factors, and rapidity-ordered soft-quark configurations, leading to
implicit integral equations, which so far have only been studied in the context
of energetic muon-electron backward scattering. We find that the all-order
structure of the double logarithms is governed by a novel type of coupled
integral equations, which encode the non-trivial interplay between these two
effects. Whereas a closed-form solution to these equations is currently
unknown, we present useful iteration formulas, and derive the asymptotic
behaviour of the soft-overlap form factor for infinitely large recoil energies,
showing that the Sudakov suppression is somewhat weakened by the intertwined
soft-quark and soft-gluon corrections. In a broader context, our findings shed
light onto the physical origin and mathematical structure of endpoint
divergences arising from soft-collinear factorization and the related Feynman
mechanism for power-suppressed hard exclusive processes.

**Abstract**: Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and
abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with
tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective
behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can
exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning
evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity,
the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance,
chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent
phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom,
analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller
impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable
evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton
condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the
polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an
evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic
condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference
patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow
subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field
theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study
condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled
nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.

**PDF Url**: [2412.14115v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14115v1)

**Abstract**: Muon colliders provide an exciting new path pushing forward the energy
frontier of particle physics. We point out a new use of these facilities for
neutrino physics and beyond the Standard Model physics \emph{using their main
detectors}. Muon decays along the main accelerator rings induce an intense,
highly collimated beam of neutrinos. As this beam crosses a thin slice of the
kt-scale detector, it would induce unprecedented numbers of neutrino
interactions, with $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ events per second for a 10 TeV
$\mu^+\mu^-$ collider. We characterize these events, showing that they are
highly energetic and possess a distinct timing signature with a large
transverse displacement. We discuss promising applications of these events for
instrumentation, electroweak, and beyond-the-Standard Model physics. For
instance, we show that a sub-percent measurement of the neutrino-electron
scattering rate enables new precision measurements of the Weak angle and a
novel detection of the neutrino charge radius.


### Gluon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity GPDs from Lattice QCD: Lorentz-Covariant Parametrization (Part I)
**Authors**: Jakob Schoenleber, Raza Sabbir Sufian, Taku Izubuchi, Yi-Bo Yang

**PDF Url**: [2412.14110v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14110v1)

**Abstract**: We identify the matrix elements necessary to determine the chiral-even
$H_g,~E_g,~\widetilde{H}_g,~\widetilde{E}_g$ and chiral-odd $H^T_g,~E^T_g,
\widetilde{H}^T_g ,~\widetilde{E}^T_g$ gluon generalized parton distributions
(GPDs) in lattice QCD calculations. We present a method to achieve a
Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a
linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is
crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto lightcone
distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components
that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce
to the different gluon GPDs in the lightcone limit and enable their separation
in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons.
Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the
gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing
our understanding of the mass and spin structures, and mechanical properties of
the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton
scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental
processes.


### Path integral measure and RG equations for gravity

**PDF Url**: [2412.14108v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14108v1)

**Abstract**: Considering the Einstein-Hilbert truncation for the running action in
(euclidean) quantum gravity, we derive the renormalization group equations for
the cosmological and Newton constant. We find that these equations admit only
the Gaussian fixed point with a UV-attractive and a UV-repulsive
eigendirection, and that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive
fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a
careful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running
action and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also
show why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the
aforementioned UV-attractive fixed point is generated.


### Hyperbolic Quantum Processor

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-18

**PDF Url**: [2412.14098v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14098v1)

**Abstract**: Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large
distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology,
including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum
simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks.
However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum
emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of
quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range
qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated
by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of
the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting
quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits
based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated
by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as
e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is
essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to
the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the
integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the
way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define
the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond
time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen
temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require
dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum
computation to the realm of conventional engineering.


## Diffusion
### E-CAR: Efficient Continuous Autoregressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling
**Authors**: Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Hanling Zhang, Tongcheng Fang, Rui Xie, Bingxin Xu, Yan Yan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-12-18

**PDF Url**: [2412.14170v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14170v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models with continuous tokens for
image generation show promising results by eliminating the need for discrete
tokenization. However, these models face efficiency challenges due to their
sequential token generation nature and reliance on computationally intensive
diffusion-based sampling. We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive
Image Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these
limitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous
token generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides
progressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a
multistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only
partial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in
normal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at
increasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage.
This design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of
the stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our
approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally
with image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and
following a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to
DiT Peebles & Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\times$ FLOPs reduction and
5$\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\times$256 image.


### VideoDPO: Omni-Preference Alignment for Video Diffusion Generation
**Authors**: Runtao Liu, Haoyu Wu, Zheng Ziqiang, Chen Wei, Yingqing He, Renjie Pi, Qifeng Chen

**Published Date**: 2024-12-18

**Abstract**: Recent progress in generative diffusion models has greatly advanced
text-to-video generation. While text-to-video models trained on large-scale,
diverse datasets can produce varied outputs, these generations often deviate
from user preferences, highlighting the need for preference alignment on
pre-trained models. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has
demonstrated significant improvements in language and image generation, we
pioneer its adaptation to video diffusion models and propose a VideoDPO
pipeline by making several key adjustments. Unlike previous image alignment
methods that focus solely on either (i) visual quality or (ii) semantic
alignment between text and videos, we comprehensively consider both dimensions
and construct a preference score accordingly, which we term the OmniScore. We
design a pipeline to automatically collect preference pair data based on the
proposed OmniScore and discover that re-weighting these pairs based on the
score significantly impacts overall preference alignment. Our experiments
demonstrate substantial improvements in both visual quality and semantic
alignment, ensuring that no preference aspect is neglected. Code and data will
be shared at https://videodpo.github.io/.


### AKiRa: Augmentation Kit on Rays for optical video generation
**Authors**: Xi Wang, Robin Courant, Marc Christie, Vicky Kalogeiton

**Published Date**: 2024-12-18

**PDF Url**: [2412.14158v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14158v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in text-conditioned video diffusion have greatly improved
video quality. However, these methods offer limited or sometimes no control to
users on camera aspects, including dynamic camera motion, zoom, distorted lens
and focus shifts. These motion and optical aspects are crucial for adding
controllability and cinematic elements to generation frameworks, ultimately
resulting in visual content that draws focus, enhances mood, and guides
emotions according to filmmakers' controls. In this paper, we aim to close the
gap between controllable video generation and camera optics. To achieve this,
we propose AKiRa (Augmentation Kit on Rays), a novel augmentation framework
that builds and trains a camera adapter with a complex camera model over an
existing video generation backbone. It enables fine-tuned control over camera
motion as well as complex optical parameters (focal length, distortion,
aperture) to achieve cinematic effects such as zoom, fisheye effect, and bokeh.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AKiRa's effectiveness in combining and
composing camera optics while outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. This
work sets a new landmark in controlled and optically enhanced video generation,
paving the way for future optical video generation methods.


### Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models
**Authors**: George Rapakoulias, Ali Reza Pedram, Panagiotis Tsiotras

**Published Date**: 2024-12-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-18

**PDF Url**: [2412.09059v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09059v2)

**Abstract**: Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges (SB) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite
time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a
suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have
recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require
computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional
problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of
feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard
non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be
approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose
dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture.
Furthermore, our method generalizes naturally to more general classes of
dynamical systems such as controllable Linear Time-Varying systems that cannot
currently be solved using traditional neural SB approaches. We showcase the
potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as
image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, and various
other examples. We also benchmark our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport
(EOT) problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases
where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually
no training.


### SwiftTry: Fast and Consistent Video Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-18

**PDF Url**: [2412.10178v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10178v2)

**Abstract**: Given an input video of a person and a new garment, the objective of this
paper is to synthesize a new video where the person is wearing the specified
garment while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. Although significant
advances have been made in image-based virtual try-on, extending these
successes to video often leads to frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Some
approaches have attempted to address this by increasing the overlap of frames
across multiple video chunks, but this comes at a steep computational cost due
to the repeated processing of the same frames, especially for long video
sequences. To tackle these challenges, we reconceptualize video virtual try-on
as a conditional video inpainting task, with garments serving as input
conditions. Specifically, our approach enhances image diffusion models by
incorporating temporal attention layers to improve temporal coherence. To
reduce computational overhead, we propose ShiftCaching, a novel technique that
maintains temporal consistency while minimizing redundant computations.
Furthermore, we introduce the TikTokDress dataset, a new video try-on dataset
featuring more complex backgrounds, challenging movements, and higher
resolution compared to existing public datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current baselines, particularly in
terms of video consistency and inference speed. The project page is available

## Quantitative Finance
### Interpretable LLM-based Table Question Answering
**Authors**: Giang, Nguyen, Ivan Brugere, Shubham Sharma, Sanjay Kariyappa, Anh Totti Nguyen, Freddy Lecue

**Published Date**: 2024-12-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.12386v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12386v1)

**Abstract**: Interpretability for Table Question Answering (Table QA) is critical,
particularly in high-stakes industries like finance or healthcare. Although
recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved Table QA performance, their explanations for how the answers are
generated are ambiguous. To fill this gap, we introduce Plan-of-SQLs ( or POS),
an interpretable, effective, and efficient approach to Table QA that answers an
input query solely with SQL executions. Through qualitative and quantitative
evaluations with human and LLM judges, we show that POS is most preferred among
explanation methods, helps human users understand model decision boundaries,
and facilitates model success and error identification. Furthermore, when
evaluated in standard benchmarks (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FetaQA), POS achieves
competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, while
maintaining greater efficiency by requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and
database queries.
