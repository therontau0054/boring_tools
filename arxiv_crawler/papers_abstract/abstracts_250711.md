**Abstract**: We extend from the hyperfinite setting to general von Neumann algebras
Mosonyi and Ogawa's (2015) and Mosonyi and Hiai's (2023) results showing the
operational interpretation of sandwiched relative R\'enyi entropy in the strong
converse of hypothesis testing. The specific task is to distinguish between two
quantum states given many copies. We use a reduction method of Haagerup, Junge,
and Xu (2010) to approximate relative entropy inequalities in an arbitrary von
Neumann algebra by those in finite von Neumann algebras. Within these finite
von Neumann algebras, it is possible to approximate densities via finite
spectrum operators, after which the quantum method of types reduces them to
effectively commuting subalgebras. Generalizing beyond the hyperfinite setting
shows that the operational meaning of sandwiched R\'enyi entropy is not
restricted to the matrices but is a more fundamental property of quantum
information. Furthermore, applicability in general von Neumann algebras opens
potential new connections to random matrix theory and the quantum information
theory of fundamental physics.

**Abstract**: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

### From spatial to null infinity: Connecting initial data to peeling
**Authors**: Berend Schneider, Neev Khera

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07977v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07977v1)

**Abstract**: The asymptotic structure of space-time is studied by imposing conditions on
the asymptotics of the metric. These conditions are weak enough to include
large classes of physically relevant isolated space-times, but have a rich
enough structure to be able to define important physically meaningful
quantities like mass, angular momentum, and gravitational waves.
  By using a unified expansion of the metric in a neighborhood of spatial
infinity that includes a piece of null infinity, we connect the asymptotic
expansions of solutions to Einstein's equations in the different asymptotic
regimes. Within the class of space-times under consideration, we find a
connection between the peeling properties of the Weyl scalars and symmetries of
initial data near spatial infinity. In particular, we show that for initial
data that to leading order is symmetric under parity + time reversal, $\Psi_2$
has the usual $1/r^3$ fall-off rate at null infinity. If, in addition, the
subleading part of the data is antisymmetric under parity + time reversal, then
$\Psi_1$ has the usual $1/r^4$ fall-off rate at future null infinity.


### Spectral networks for polynomial cubic differentials
**Authors**: Omar Kidwai, Guillaume Tahar

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07971v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07971v1)

**Abstract**: We study cubic differentials and their spectral networks on Riemann surfaces,
focusing on the polynomial case on the Riemann sphere. We introduce the notion
of spectral core as the primary tool for our study, refining the classical
notion of core in the theory of flat surfaces, and show that it controls the
birthing process of spectral network trajectories. As an application, we
completely characterize the polynomial cubic differentials having saddle
connections or critical tripods when the degree $d$ is at most $3$; in
particular, we obtain the relevant degenerations as the phase is varied and
determine explicitly the wall-and-chamber structure. In this case, we obtain
the BPS structure according to Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke's algorithm, and verify
that it satisfies the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. In physics
language, this corresponds to computing the BPS spectrum of a certain
four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory, known as the
$(A_{2},A_{d-1})$ generalized Argyres-Douglas theory.


### Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Inference of Liquid Structure from Scattering Data
**Authors**: Harry W. Sullivan, Brennon L. Shanks, Matej Cervenka, Michael P. Hoepfner

**Published Date**: 2025-07-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07948v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07948v1)

**Abstract**: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution
functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty
quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process
prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical
challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning
and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical
knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the
Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. The
methodology is applied to liquid argon and water as a proof of principle. The
full implementation is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/hoepfnergroup/LiquidStructureGP-Sullivan.


### Dirt/Detector/Dump: Complementary BSM production at Short-Baseline Neutrino Facilities
**Authors**: Bhaskar Dutta, Debopam Goswami, Aparajitha Karthikeyan, Kevin J. Kelly

**Published Date**: 2025-01-16

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2501.09840v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09840v2)

**Abstract**: Short-baseline neutrino (SBN) facilities are optimal for new-physics
searches, including the possible production of new particles in and along the
neutrino beamline. One such class of models considers states that are created
by neutrino upscattering that then decay in the neutrino detector -- in the
past, such upscattering has often been considered to occur in the detector
itself (with a prompt decay) or in the dirt upstream of the detector. In this
work, we highlight the importance of the beam dumps, situated even further
upstream, for such searches. The Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, with its iron
dump, provides one such possibility. We focus on sub-GeV heavy neutral leptons
(HNLs) with a transition magnetic moment, which allows this upscattering to
take advantage of the high-$Z$ iron. We observe that, in addition to increased
sensitivity to this model at SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, there exist distinct
features in the signal events' kinematical properties when coming from
production in the dump, dirt, and detector which can allow for enhanced
signal-to-background separation. We highlight the complementarity of this
approach to study parameter space relevant for the MiniBooNE low-energy excess,
as well as in models in which the HNLs couple to a light scalar particle.


### A statistical physics framework for optimal learning

**Abstract**: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

**Authors**: Henok Weldeyesus, Taras Patlatiuk, Qianqian Chen, Christian P. Scheller, Amir Yacoby, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Dominik M. Zumbühl

**PDF Url**: [2507.07905v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07905v1)

**Abstract**: Edge states reflect the key physical properties yet are difficult to probe
individually, particularly when several states are present at an edge. We
present momentum resolved tunneling spectroscopy between a quantum well and a
quantum wire to extract the dispersions of the quantum Hall edge states.
Momentum and energy selective tunneling allows to separately address the
different states even if they are spatially overlapping. This delivers the edge
state velocities over broad ranges of magnetic field and density, in excellent
agreement with a hard-wall model. This technique provides a basis for future
edge state selective spectroscopy on quantum materials.


### Axionic defects in the CMB: birefringence and gravitational waves

**Abstract**: The evidence for a non-vanishing isotropic cosmic birefringence in recent
analyses of the CMB data provides a tantalizing hint for new physics. Domain
wall (DW) networks have recently been shown to generate an isotropic
birefringence signal in the ballpark of the measured value when coupled to
photons. In this work, we explore the axionic defects hypothesis in more detail
and extending previous results to annihilating and late-forming networks, and
by pointing out other smoking-gun signatures of the network in the CMB spectrum
such as the anisotropic birefringent spectrum and B-modes. We also argue that
the presence of cosmic strings in the network does not hinder a large isotropic
birefringence signal because of an intrinsic environmental contribution coming
from low redshifts thus leaving open the possibility that axionic defects can
explain the signal. Regarding the remaining CMB signatures, with the help of
dedicated 3D numerical simulations of DW networks, that we took as a proxy for
the axionic defects, we show how the anisotropic birefringence spectrum
combined with a tomographic approach can be used to infer the formation and
annihilation time of the network. From the numerical simulations, we also
computed the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the network in
the post-recombination epoch and use previous searches for stochastic GW
backgrounds in the CMB to derive for the first time a bound on the tension and
abundance of networks with DWs that annihilate after recombination. Our bounds
extend to the case where the network survives until the present time and
improve over previous bounds by roughly one order of magnitude. Finally, we
show the interesting prospects for detecting B-modes of DW origin with future
CMB experiments.


### Capturing quantum phase transition in the ultraviolet region by holography
**Authors**: Fang-Jing Cheng, Zhe Yang, Yi Ling, Jian-Pin Wu, Zhou-Jian Cao, Peng Liu

**PDF Url**: [2507.07899v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07899v1)

**Abstract**: We reveal for the first time that ultraviolet (UV) observables can diagnose
quantum phase transitions (QPTs). In a class of holographic models exhibiting
metal-insulator transitions, we study two types of UV observables --
high-frequency conductivity and short-range entanglement. Remarkably, we find
that the derivatives of these UV observables exhibit extrema near the quantum
critical point. Analytical results show these critical behaviors arise from the
deformation of the asymptotic bulk geometry. Moreover, these UV diagnostics
show enhanced robustness to thermal fluctuations compared to typical infrared
(IR) diagnostics, providing a clean method to identify quantum criticality at
finite temperature. This work opens a new window for exploring quantum critical
phenomena via UV physics in the laboratory.


## Diffusion
### EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies
**Authors**: Perry Dong, Qiyang Li, Dorsa Sadigh, Chelsea Finn

**Published Date**: 2025-07-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07986v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07986v1)

**Abstract**: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.


### Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts
**Authors**: Sol Yarkoni, Roi Livni

**Published Date**: 2025-07-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07947v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07947v1)

**Abstract**: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

**Abstract**: Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing
attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families
of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs)
demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion
models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal
generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of
multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the
unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for
unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and
diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling
procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to
image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we
explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and
generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we
investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based
modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then
introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential
advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets
widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we
present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to
the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.


### Re-Bottleneck: Latent Re-Structuring for Neural Audio Autoencoders
**Authors**: Dimitrios Bralios, Jonah Casebeer, Paris Smaragdis

**Published Date**: 2025-07-10

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07867v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07867v1)

**Abstract**: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.


### Predicting and generating antibiotics against future pathogens with ApexOracle
**Authors**: Tianang Leng, Fangping Wan, Marcelo Der Torossian Torres, Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-10

**PDF Url**: [2507.07862v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07862v1)

**Abstract**: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.
