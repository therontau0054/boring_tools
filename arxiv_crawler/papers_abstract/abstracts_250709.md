**Abstract**: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain
fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective
Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing
relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal
mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed
thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or
newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that
integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a
simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient
to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively
accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers.
Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it
by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability
in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data.
Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal
mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our
results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy
polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials
discovery.

**Abstract**: We present results from a global fit of Standard Model parameters and
dimension-6 SMEFT Wilson coefficients that includes electroweak, Drell-Yan,
Higgs-boson, top-quark, and flavour observables. Fits obtained by floating
individual coefficients are also discussed. The leading-order scale dependence
of the SMEFT Wilson coefficients is consistently included in the evolution from
the UV scale to the electroweak scale and the low-energy scale of flavour
observables. In defining the SMEFT set of active operators we consider both the
$U(3)^5$ and the $U(2)^5$ flavour symmetric limits. All fits are obtained
within the $\texttt{HEPfit}$ framework and are based on the most recent
experimental results and state-of-the-art theoretical predictions for all the
observables considered.

**Abstract**: Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting
physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in
moir\'e materials. When topological flat bands possess concentrated quantum
geometry, a topological heavy fermion (THF) model was proposed as the starting
point to describe the interacting moir\'e physics. In this work, we propose a
design principle for realizing "ideal" THF model, which can host an exact flat
band with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric
equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moir\'e
heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moir\'e
Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands
can be realized in this model when the moir\'e superlattice potential is
stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map
this model into a THF model that consists of a localized orbital for
"f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the
flatness and quantum geometry of the mini-bands in this THF model depend on the
energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is
experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will
allow us to realize an "ideal" topological flat band with zero band-width and
"ideal quantum geometry" in this THF model. Our design strategy of topological
flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material
candidates for moir\'e heterostructures with type-II band alignment.

**Abstract**: SoLid is a neutrino experiment at very-short baseline searching for
active-to-sterile oscillations of reactor antineutrinos. The detection
principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators:
polyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this
field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup
allows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm
cube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise
localisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an
antineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a
powerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of
the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled
to photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with
horizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in
which a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy
deposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per
fibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring
detection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached.
The paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale.
The first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to
around 10\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such
muons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is
proposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process
and provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD
positron spectrum). The paper is concluded with various cross-check including a
determination of the energy spectrum of the standard cosmogenic background
candle: $^{12}$B.

**Abstract**: Mott's variable range hopping (v.r.h.) is the phonon-induced hopping of
electrons in disordered solids (such as doped semiconductors) within the regime
of strong Anderson localization. It was introduced by N.~Mott to explain the
anomalous low temperature conductivity decay in dimension $d\geq 2$,
corresponding now to the so called Mott's law. We provide a rigorous derivation
of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random
resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk.
We also determine the constant multiplying the power of the inverse temperature
in the exponent in Mott's law, which was an open problem also on a heuristic
level.


### A Homothetic Gauge Theory

**Abstract**: While the principle of local gauge invariance forms the bedrock of modern
physics, the symmetry of scale invariance has traditionally been treated on a
different footing. This paper develops a \emph{homothetic gauge theory} (HGT)
that elevates local scale transformations to a genuine gauge symmetry, placing
them within the same geometric framework as conventional interactions. We
introduce a novel mathematical structure based on an extended vector bundle
that linearizes the action of local scaling, allowing for the definition of a
homothetic connection and a corresponding gauge-covariant field strength. When
this formalism is applied to classical U(1) electromagnetism, the theory yields
a generalized field-strength tensor that naturally incorporates both the
standard Maxwell field and a new scalar partner field governing the local
scale. The resulting dynamics, including modified conservation laws and wave
equations, are shown to be fully consistent. As a significant physical
application, this framework provides a compelling resolution to the classical
problem of the infinite self-energy of a point charge. By modeling the source
as a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition on a shrinking interface, we
construct a non-singular electrostatic potential, thereby removing the
divergence in a natural, geometric manner without introducing ad-hoc
regularization schemes. The emergence of penalty terms due to essentially
geometric transformations promises a physically meaningful theory, and
encourages to re-examining the role of scale invariance in other areas of
classical and quantum field theory.

**Abstract**: Multi-UAV pursuit-evasion, where pursuers aim to capture evaders, poses a key
challenge for UAV swarm intelligence. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
has demonstrated potential in modeling cooperative behaviors, but most RL-based
approaches remain constrained to simplified simulations with limited dynamics
or fixed scenarios. Previous attempts to deploy RL policy to real-world
pursuit-evasion are largely restricted to two-dimensional scenarios, such as
ground vehicles or UAVs at fixed altitudes. In this paper, we address multi-UAV
pursuit-evasion by considering UAV dynamics and physical constraints. We
introduce an evader prediction-enhanced network to tackle partial observability
in cooperative strategy learning. Additionally, we propose an adaptive
environment generator within MARL training, enabling higher exploration
efficiency and better policy generalization across diverse scenarios.
Simulations show our method significantly outperforms all baselines in
challenging scenarios, generalizing to unseen scenarios with a 100% capture
rate. Finally, we derive a feasible policy via a two-stage reward refinement
and deploy the policy on real quadrotors in a zero-shot manner. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to derive and deploy an RL-based policy using
collective thrust and body rates control commands for multi-UAV pursuit-evasion
in unknown environments. The open-source code and videos are available at

**PDF Url**: [2507.06139v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06139v1)

**Abstract**: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

**PDF Url**: [2507.06104v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06104v1)

**Abstract**: In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of
homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous $SU(2)$ connections on
three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of
the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional
topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy
groups.
  Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the
Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a
mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen
connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct
formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of
homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the
spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
  The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many
of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of
regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they
provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in
the cosmological setting.


## Diffusion
### StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation
**Authors**: Akio Kodaira, Chenfeng Xu, Toshiki Hazama, Takanori Yoshimoto, Kohei Ohno, Shogo Mitsuhori, Soichi Sugano, Hanying Cho, Zhijian Liu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer

**Published Date**: 2023-12-19

**PDF Url**: [2312.12491v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12491v2)

**Abstract**: We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for
interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating
images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time
interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios
involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and
broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present
a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the
batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional
wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To
handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we
design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process.
Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG),
which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant
computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG)
algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to
only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity
filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around
1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising
levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the
conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature
acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps
on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers
over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly
reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one
RTX4090, respectively.

**Abstract**: Associative Memories like the famous Hopfield Networks are elegant models for
describing fully recurrent neural networks whose fundamental job is to store
and retrieve information. In the past few years they experienced a surge of
interest due to novel theoretical results pertaining to their information
storage capabilities, and their relationship with SOTA AI architectures, such
as Transformers and Diffusion Models. These connections open up possibilities
for interpreting the computation of traditional AI networks through the
theoretical lens of Associative Memories. Additionally, novel Lagrangian
formulations of these networks make it possible to design powerful distributed
models that learn useful representations and inform the design of novel
architectures. This tutorial provides an approachable introduction to
Associative Memories, emphasizing the modern language and methods used in this
area of research, with practical hands-on mathematical derivations and coding
notebooks.


### Few-Shot Learning by Explicit Physics Integration: An Application to Groundwater Heat Transport
**Authors**: Julia Pelzer, Corné Verburg, Alexander Heinlein, Miriam Schulte

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-08

**PDF Url**: [2507.06062v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06062v1)

**Abstract**: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.


### UniCombine: Unified Multi-Conditional Combination with Diffusion Transformer

**PDF Url**: [2503.09277v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09277v2)

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of diffusion models in image generation, the
demand for more powerful and flexible controllable frameworks is increasing.
Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the
challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while
maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we
introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative
framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not
limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we
introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a
trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based
versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct
SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative
tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions.
Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the
outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with
state-of-the-art performance.


### TextPixs: Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention and OCR-Guided Supervision

**Abstract**: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

**PDF Url**: [2507.04176v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04176v2)

**Abstract**: Portfolio optimization is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance,
requiring robust computational tools that integrate statistical rigor with
practical implementation. We present skfolio, an open-source Python library for
portfolio construction and risk management that seamlessly integrates with the
scikit-learn ecosystem. skfolio provides a unified framework for diverse
allocation strategies, from classical mean-variance optimization to modern
clustering-based methods, state-of-the-art financial estimators with native
interfaces, and advanced cross-validation techniques tailored for financial
time series. By adhering to scikit-learn's fit-predict-transform paradigm, the
library enables researchers and practitioners to leverage machine learning
workflows for portfolio optimization, promoting reproducibility and
transparency in quantitative finance.
