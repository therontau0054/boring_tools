**Abstract**: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential
expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a
particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as
eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum
exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle
production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter
conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or
interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using
Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum
eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed
spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it
reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning.
We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving
particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.

**Abstract**: While machine learning (ML) models have been able to achieve unprecedented
accuracies across various prediction tasks in quantum chemistry, it is now
apparent that accuracy on a test set alone is not a guarantee for robust
chemical modeling such as stable molecular dynamics (MD). To go beyond
accuracy, we use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to
develop a general analysis framework for atomic interactions and apply it to
the SchNet and PaiNN neural network models. We compare these interactions with
a set of fundamental chemical principles to understand how well the models have
learned the underlying physicochemical concepts from the data. We focus on the
strength of the interactions for different atomic species, how predictions for
intensive and extensive quantum molecular properties are made, and analyze the
decay and many-body nature of the interactions with interatomic distance.
Models that deviate too far from known physical principles produce unstable MD
trajectories, even when they have very high energy and force prediction
accuracy. We also suggest further improvements to the ML architectures to
better account for the polynomial decay of atomic interactions.

**Abstract**: Long-range interactions are crucial in determining the behavior of chemical
systems in various environments. Accurate predictions of physical and chemical
phenomena at the atomic level hinge on accurate modeling of these interactions.
Here, we present a framework that substantially enhances the predictive power
of machine learning interatomic potentials by incorporating explicit
polarizable long-range interactions with an equivariant graph neural network
short-range potential. The pretrained universal model, applicable across the
entire periodic table, can achieve first-principles accuracy. This versatile
model has been further applied to diverse areas of research, including the
study of mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes,
ferroelectricity, and interfacial reactions, demonstrating its broad
applicability and robustness.


### Moderate Physical Perspectivalism

**Abstract**: Recent developments in foundations of physics have given rise to a class of
views suggesting that physically meaningful descriptions must always be
relativized to a physical perspective. In this article I distinguish between
strong physical perspectivalism, which maintains that all facts must be
relativized to a perspective, and moderate physical perspectivalism, which
maintains that all empirically meaningful descriptions must be relativized to a
perspective. I argue that both scientific evidence and philosophical
considerations support moderate physical perspectivalism over strong physical
perspectivalism. In particular, motivations connected to epistemic humility and
the social nature of science are more compatible with the moderate approach.

**Abstract**: Spontaneous particle-pair formation is a fundamental phenomenon in nature. It
can, for example, appear when the potential energy between two particles
increases with separation, as if they were connected by a tense string. Beyond
a critical separation, new particle pairs can form, causing the string to
break. String-breaking dynamics in quantum chromodynamics play a vital role in
high-energy particle collisions and early universe evolution. Simulating string
evolution and hadron formation is, therefore, a grand challenge in modern
physics. Quantum simulators, well-suited for studying dynamics, are expected to
outperform classical computing methods. However, the required experimental
capabilities to simulate string-breaking dynamics have not yet been
demonstrated, even for simpler models of the strong force. We experimentally
probe, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of string-breaking in a
(1+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory using a fully
programmable trapped-ion quantum simulator. We emulate external static charges
and strings via site-dependent magnetic-field control enabled by a dual array
of tightly focused laser beams targeting individual ions. First, we study how
confinement affects isolated charges, finding that they freely spread without
string tension but exhibit localized oscillations when tension is increased.
Then, we observe and characterize string-breaking dynamics of a string
stretched between two static charges after an abrupt increase in string
tension. Charge pairs appear near the string edges and spread into the bulk,
revealing a route to dynamical string-breaking distinct from the conventional
Schwinger mechanism. Our work demonstrates that analog quantum simulators have
achieved the necessary control to explore string-breaking dynamics, which may
ultimately be relevant to nuclear and high-energy physics.

**Abstract**: The ability to reason with and integrate different sensory inputs is the
foundation underpinning human intelligence and it is the reason for the growing
interest in modelling multi-modal information within Knowledge Graphs.
Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs extend traditional Knowledge Graphs by associating
an entity with its possible modal representations, including text, images,
audio, and videos, all of which are used to convey the semantics of the entity.
Despite the increasing attention that Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs have
received, there is a lack of consensus about the definitions and modelling of
modalities, whose definition is often determined by application domains. In
this paper, we propose a novel ontology design pattern that captures the
separation of concerns between an entity (and the information it conveys),
whose semantics can have different manifestations across different media, and
its realisation in terms of a physical information entity. By introducing this
abstract model, we aim to facilitate the harmonisation and integration of
different existing multi-modal ontologies which is crucial for many intelligent
applications across different domains spanning from medicine to digital
humanities.

**Abstract**: The telecommunications industry's deployment of billions of kilometers of
optical fiber has created a vast global network that can be exploited for
additional applications such as environmental sensing, quantum networking and
international clock comparisons. However, for reasons such as the
unidirectionality of long-haul fiber links, telecom fiber networks cannot
always be adapted for important applications beyond data transmission.
Fortunately, new multicore optical fibers create the opportunity for
application coexistence with data traffic, creating expansive multifunctional
networks. Towards that end, we propose and demonstrate the faithful transfer of
ultrastable optical signals through multicore fiber in a way that is compatible
with the unidirectionality of long-haul fiber optic systems, demonstrating a
fractional frequency instability of 3x10-19 at 10,000 seconds. This opens the
door towards intercontinental optical clock comparisons, with applications in
fundamental physics and the redefinition of the second.

**Abstract**: The search for weakly interacting matter particles (WIMPs) is one of the main
objectives of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In this work
we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to explore WIMP radiative decays into a
Dark Matter (DM) candidate in a supersymmetric framework. The minimal
supersymmetric WIMP sector includes the lightest neutralino that can provide
the observed DM relic density through its co-annihilation with the second
lightest neutralino and lightest chargino. Moreover, the direct DM detection
cross section rates fulfill current experimental bounds and provide discovery
targets for the same region of model parameters in which the radiative decay of
the second lightest neutralino into a photon and the lightest neutralino is
enhanced. This strongly motivates the search for radiatively decaying
neutralinos which, however, suffers from strong backgrounds. We investigate the
LHC reach in the search for these radiatively decaying particles by means of
cut-based and ML methods and estimate its discovery potential in this
well-motivated, new physics scenario.


### Arbitrarily-Conditioned Multi-Functional Diffusion for Multi-Physics Emulation

**Abstract**: Modern physics simulation often involves multiple functions of interests, and
traditional numerical approaches are known to be complex and computationally
costly. While machine learning-based surrogate models can offer significant
cost reductions, most focus on a single task, such as forward prediction, and
typically lack uncertainty quantification -- an essential component in many
applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose Arbitrarily-Conditioned
Multi-Functional Diffusion (ACMFD), a versatile probabilistic surrogate model
for multi-physics emulation. ACMFD can perform a wide range of tasks within a
single framework, including forward prediction, various inverse problems, and
simulating data for entire systems or subsets of quantities conditioned on
others. Specifically, we extend the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Model (DDPM) for multi-functional generation by modeling noise as Gaussian
processes (GP). We then introduce an innovative denoising loss. The training
involves randomly sampling the conditioned part and fitting the corresponding
predicted noise to zero, enabling ACMFD to flexibly generate function values
conditioned on any other functions or quantities. To enable efficient training
and sampling, and to flexibly handle irregularly sampled data, we use GPs to
interpolate function samples onto a grid, inducing a Kronecker product
structure for efficient computation. We demonstrate the advantages of ACMFD
across several fundamental multi-physics systems.

**Abstract**: We address the dynamical bipartite entanglement in an opto-electro-mechanical
system that involves a three-level atom. The system consists of a degenerate
three-level atom, a mechanical resonator, an optical cavity, and a microwave
cavity. By utilizing the linearization approximation and nonlinear
quantum-Langevin equations, the dynamics of the system are analyzed, and the
bipartite entanglement is evaluated using the logarithmic negativity. The
research findings indicate that the entanglement between each subsystem
increases with the atom injection rate, suggesting that a higher atom injection
rate leads to enhanced information transmission between the subsystems.
Additionally, it is observed that the correlation between subsystems increases
with an increase in the coupling rate. Moreover, the study demonstrates that
the correlation between each subsystem decreases as temperature rises. We also
show that the degree of tripartite entanglement diminishes with increasing
atomic decay rates. The results highlight the positive impact of three-level
atoms on the bipartite entanglement in an opto-electro-mechanical system.
Consequently, such electro-optomechanical systems can offer a framework for
optomechanical information transfer.


## Diffusion
### Diffusing States and Matching Scores: A New Framework for Imitation Learning

**Abstract**: Adversarial Imitation Learning is traditionally framed as a two-player
zero-sum game between a learner and an adversarially chosen cost function, and
can therefore be thought of as the sequential generalization of a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN). A prominent example of this framework is Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). However, in recent years, diffusion
models have emerged as a non-adversarial alternative to GANs that merely
require training a score function via regression, yet produce generations of a
higher quality. In response, we investigate how to lift insights from diffusion
modeling to the sequential setting. We propose diffusing states and performing
score-matching along diffused states to measure the discrepancy between the
expert's and learner's states. Thus, our approach only requires training score
functions to predict noises via standard regression, making it significantly
easier and more stable to train than adversarial methods. Theoretically, we
prove first- and second-order instance-dependent bounds with linear scaling in
the horizon, proving that our approach avoids the compounding errors that
stymie offline approaches to imitation learning. Empirically, we show our
approach outperforms GAN-style imitation learning baselines across various
continuous control problems, including complex tasks like controlling humanoids
to walk, sit, and crawl.


### Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Bruno Mlodozeniec, Runa Eschenhagen, Juhan Bae, Alexander Immer, David Krueger, Richard Turner

**Published Date**: 2024-10-17

**PDF Url**: [2410.13850v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13850v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative
modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data
attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such
challenges in diffusion models by developing an \textit{influence functions}
framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a
model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In
supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a
particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting
the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several
proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such
quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular
design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian
computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC
approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored
to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design
choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms
previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear
Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the
need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.


### DPLM-2: A Multimodal Diffusion Protein Language Model

**Abstract**: Proteins are essential macromolecules defined by their amino acid sequences,
which determine their three-dimensional structures and, consequently, their
functions in all living organisms. Therefore, generative protein modeling
necessitates a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and
generate both sequences and structures. However, existing methods typically use
separate models for each modality, limiting their ability to capture the
intricate relationships between sequence and structure. This results in
suboptimal performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and
generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce DPLM-2, a multimodal
protein foundation model that extends discrete diffusion protein language model
(DPLM) to accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable structural
learning with the language model, 3D coordinates are converted to discrete
tokens using a lookup-free quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both
experimental and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint
distribution of sequence and structure, as well as their marginals and
conditionals. We also implement an efficient warm-up strategy to exploit the
connection between large-scale evolutionary data and structural inductive
biases from pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical
evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate highly compatible
amino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D structures eliminating the need
for a two-stage generation approach. Moreover, DPLM-2 demonstrates competitive
performance in various conditional generation tasks, including folding, inverse
folding, and scaffolding with multimodal motif inputs, as well as providing
structure-aware representations for predictive tasks.


### Probing the Latent Hierarchical Structure of Data via Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: High-dimensional data must be highly structured to be learnable. Although the
compositional and hierarchical nature of data is often put forward to explain
learnability, quantitative measurements establishing these properties are
scarce. Likewise, accessing the latent variables underlying such a data
structure remains a challenge. In this work, we show that forward-backward
experiments in diffusion-based models, where data is noised and then denoised
to generate new samples, are a promising tool to probe the latent structure of
data. We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes
in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a
noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we
confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art
diffusion models. Our results show how latent variable changes manifest in the
data and establish how to measure these effects in real data using diffusion
models.


### Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design

**PDF Url**: [2405.11785v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11785v2)

**Abstract**: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite
recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules
that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe
IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective
optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions
guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical
space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target
physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by
generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility
on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over
10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set,
producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic
accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of
IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like
molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important
disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic
accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over
100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes,
IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than
experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring
functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead
optimization for drug discovery.
