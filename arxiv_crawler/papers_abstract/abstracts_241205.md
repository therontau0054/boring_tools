**Abstract**: Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give
the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these
analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM)
neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by
terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper
limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino
constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both
Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM
hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies
while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior,
confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic
oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\mathrm{tot} <
0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\mathrm{tot} < 0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the
Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\mathrm{tot} <
0.086\,\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different
neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints
can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we
find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically
motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding
lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.

**Abstract**: Self-organised criticality, realised through cosmological dynamics in the
early universe, is an alternative paradigm for addressing the electroweak
hierarchy problem. In this scenario, an unnaturally light Higgs boson is the
result of dynamics driving the electroweak vacuum towards a near-critical
metastable point where the Higgs mass is bounded from above by the vacuum
instability scale. To lower the vacuum instability scale close to the weak
scale, previous realisations of this mechanism introduced new vector-like
fermions coupled to the Higgs. Here we show that an Axion-Like Particle (ALP)
coupling to the Higgs is an alternative possibility for achieving criticality
with another well-motivated and naturally light candidate for new physics, thus
leading to an entirely different set of testable phenomenological signatures.
Our Axion-Higgs criticality model predicts an ALP in the MeV to
$\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV range. The entire natural region of parameter space can
be thoroughly explored by a combination of future colliders, flavour
experiments, and cosmological observatories.

**Abstract**: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context
of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality
can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of
log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of
symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group
property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an
application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological
recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this
encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this
matter.


### Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms
**Authors**: Ahmed El Alaoui

**Published Date**: 2024-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2412.03511v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03511v1)

**Abstract**: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering
takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p},
\sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of
special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large
$p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical
transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a
`soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a
distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs
measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable
algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to
an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their
success probability is not vanishingly small.

**Authors**: Hannah Banks, Elina Fuchs, Matthew McCullough

**Published Date**: 2024-07-15

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2407.11112v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11112v2)

**Abstract**: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry
experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel
detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity
of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that
possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or
clouds of atoms have the potential to complement advanced very-long-baseline
terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark
matter with scalar couplings to photons in the future. Nuclear interferometry
may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector
via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and
proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of
well-motivated parameter space.


### Soft Checksums to Flag Untrustworthy Machine Learning Surrogate Predictions and Application to Atomic Physics Simulations
**Authors**: Casey Lauer, Robert C. Blake, Jonathan B. Freund

**PDF Url**: [2412.03497v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03497v1)

**Abstract**: Trained neural networks (NN) are attractive as surrogate models to replace
costly calculations in physical simulations, but are often unknowingly applied
to states not adequately represented in the training dataset. We present the
novel technique of soft checksums for scientific machine learning, a
general-purpose method to differentiate between trustworthy predictions with
small errors on in-distribution (ID) data points, and untrustworthy predictions
with large errors on out-of-distribution (OOD) data points. By adding a check
node to the existing output layer, we train the model to learn the chosen
checksum function encoded within the NN predictions and show that violations of
this function correlate with high prediction errors. As the checksum function
depends only on the NN predictions, we can calculate the checksum error for any
prediction with a single forward pass, incurring negligible time and memory
costs. Additionally, we find that incorporating the checksum function into the
loss function and exposing the NN to OOD data points during the training
process improves separation between ID and OOD predictions. By applying soft
checksums to a physically complex and high-dimensional non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium atomic physics dataset, we show that a well-chosen threshold
checksum error can effectively separate ID and OOD predictions.

**Abstract**: In recent times machine learning methods have made significant advances in
becoming a useful tool for analyzing physical systems. A particularly active
area in this theme has been "physics-informed machine learning" which focuses
on using neural nets for numerically solving differential equations. In this
work, we aim to advance the theory of measuring out-of-sample error while
training DeepONets - which is among the most versatile ways to solve P.D.E
systems in one-shot. Firstly, for a class of DeepONets, we prove a bound on
their Rademacher complexity which does not explicitly scale with the width of
the nets involved. Secondly, we use this to show how the Huber loss can be
chosen so that for these DeepONet classes generalization error bounds can be
obtained that have no explicit dependence on the size of the nets. The
effective capacity measure for DeepONets that we thus derive is also shown to
correlate with the behavior of generalization error in experiments.

**Abstract**: Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogen
dynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein waves
controlling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding how
controllable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called
bifurcations. This endeavor is made particularly difficult in realistic
settings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and
data is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy
(Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free
approach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal
dynamics. Following classical work in spatial coarse-graining, TRENDy first
maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics via a cascade
of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition that
these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation
(NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The preceding
filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, making
TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. We
train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real data
representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We then
demonstrate how our framework can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf
bifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method
to the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through
development. We found that TRENDy's effective state not only accurately
predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct pattern
features unique to different anatomical regions, highlighting the potential
influence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role
in driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.


### Bootstrap for Finite N Lattice Yang-Mills Theory
**Authors**: Vladimir Kazakov, Zechuan Zheng

**Published Date**: 2024-04-25

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2404.16925v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16925v4)

**Abstract**: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice
Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we
examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4
dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear
and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity
significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the
convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to
length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette,
derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo
data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of
couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data
provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with
existing Monte Carlo computations.

**Abstract**: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial
polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity,
diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes
integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random
operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations
of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric
field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with
conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity
$\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix
analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory.
We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random
matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete
resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving
the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and
$\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the
components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices,
$\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures
for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of
their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection
method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the
spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a
more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk
transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by
numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and
3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.

### Navigation World Models

**Published Date**: 2024-12-04

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2412.03572v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03572v1)

**Abstract**: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities.
We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation
model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and
navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a
Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of
egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion
parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by
simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike
supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically
incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories
sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual
priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input
image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation
systems.


### Flow Matching with General Discrete Paths: A Kinetic-Optimal Perspective
**Authors**: Neta Shaul, Itai Gat, Marton Havasi, Daniel Severo, Anuroop Sriram, Peter Holderrieth, Brian Karrer, Yaron Lipman, Ricky T. Q. Chen

**Published Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2412.03487v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03487v1)

**Abstract**: The design space of discrete-space diffusion or flow generative models are
significantly less well-understood than their continuous-space counterparts,
with many works focusing only on a simple masked construction. In this work, we
aim to take a holistic approach to the construction of discrete generative
models based on continuous-time Markov chains, and for the first time, allow
the use of arbitrary discrete probability paths, or colloquially, corruption
processes. Through the lens of optimizing the symmetric kinetic energy, we
propose velocity formulas that can be applied to any given probability path,
completely decoupling the probability and velocity, and giving the user the
freedom to specify any desirable probability path based on expert knowledge
specific to the data domain. Furthermore, we find that a special construction
of mixture probability paths optimizes the symmetric kinetic energy for the
discrete case. We empirically validate the usefulness of this new design space
across multiple modalities: text generation, inorganic material generation, and
image generation. We find that we can outperform the mask construction even in
text with kinetic-optimal mixture paths, while we can make use of
domain-specific constructions of the probability path over the visual domain.


### Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching
**Authors**: Fan Zhang, Michael Gienger

**Published Date**: 2024-09-02

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2409.01083v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01083v3)

**Abstract**: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two
fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to
downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living
scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous
effort; second, effectively learning robot trajectories by grounding the visual
affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a
parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts
to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task
scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot trajectories guided by affordances in
a supervised Flow Matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor
policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot
trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across
Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation
highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation
affordance with language prompter achieves competitive performance and even
outperforms other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying
parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot trajectories with flow matching
policy also leads to consistently better results than alternative behavior
cloning methods, including marginally better generalization performance and
prominently faster inference than diffusion policy with DDPM. Our framework
seamlessly unifies affordance model learning and trajectory generation with
flow matching for robot manipulation.

**PDF Url**: [2412.03430v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03430v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly enhanced talking
face video generation, yet singing video generation remains underexplored. The
differences between human talking and singing limit the performance of existing
talking face video generation models when applied to singing. The fundamental
differences between talking and singing-specifically in audio characteristics
and behavioral expressions-limit the effectiveness of existing models. We
observe that the differences between singing and talking audios manifest in
terms of frequency and amplitude. To address this, we have designed a
multi-scale spectral module to help the model learn singing patterns in the
spectral domain. Additionally, we develop a spectral-filtering module that aids
the model in learning the human behaviors associated with singing audio. These
two modules are integrated into the diffusion model to enhance singing video
generation performance, resulting in our proposed model, SINGER. Furthermore,
the lack of high-quality real-world singing face videos has hindered the
development of the singing video generation community. To address this gap, we
have collected an in-the-wild audio-visual singing dataset to facilitate
research in this area. Our experiments demonstrate that SINGER is capable of
generating vivid singing videos and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both objective and subjective evaluations.


### DiffStyleTTS: Diffusion-based Hierarchical Prosody Modeling for Text-to-Speech with Diverse and Controllable Styles
**Authors**: Jiaxuan Liu, Zhaoci Liu, Yajun Hu, Yingying Gao, Shilei Zhang, Zhenhua Ling

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-04

**PDF Url**: [2412.03388v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03388v1)

**Abstract**: Human speech exhibits rich and flexible prosodic variations. To address the
one-to-many mapping problem from text to prosody in a reasonable and flexible
manner, we propose DiffStyleTTS, a multi-speaker acoustic model based on a
conditional diffusion module and an improved classifier-free guidance, which
hierarchically models speech prosodic features, and controls different prosodic
styles to guide prosody prediction. Experiments show that our method
outperforms all baselines in naturalness and achieves superior synthesis speed
compared to three diffusion-based baselines. Additionally, by adjusting the
guiding scale, DiffStyleTTS effectively controls the guidance intensity of the
synthetic prosody.
