**Abstract**: This study critically examines the performance of physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) approaches for traffic flow modeling, defining the failure of a
PIML model as the scenario where it underperforms both its purely data-driven
and purely physics-based counterparts. We analyze the loss landscape by
perturbing trained models along the principal eigenvectors of the Hessian
matrix and evaluating corresponding loss values. Our results suggest that
physics residuals in PIML do not inherently hinder optimization, contrary to a
commonly assumed failure cause. Instead, successful parameter updates require
both ML and physics gradients to form acute angles with the quasi-true gradient
and lie within a conical region. Given inaccuracies in both the physics models
and the training data, satisfying this condition is often difficult.
Experiments reveal that physical residuals can degrade the performance of LWR-
and ARZ-based PIML models, especially under highly physics-driven settings.
Moreover, sparse sampling and the use of temporally averaged traffic data can
produce misleadingly small physics residuals that fail to capture actual
physical dynamics, contributing to model failure. We also identify the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition as a key indicator of dataset
suitability for PIML, where successful applications consistently adhere to this
criterion. Lastly, we observe that higher-order models like ARZ tend to have
larger error lower bounds than lower-order models like LWR, which is consistent
with the experimental findings of existing studies.

**Abstract**: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld
center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property
underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is
strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical
applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector
spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not
necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X
\mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established
the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category
$\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal
C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal
V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal
C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal
C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as
a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated"
perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors
of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal
C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored
construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators
preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the
symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D
topological holography in a very general setting.

**Abstract**: In cohomological formulations of the calculus of variations obstructions to
the existence of (global) solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations can arise
in principle. It seems, however, quite common to assume that such obstructions
always vanish, at least in the cases of interest in theoretical physics. This
is not so: for Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories on compact manifolds in odd
dimensions $\geq 5$ we find a non trivial obstruction which leads to a quite
strong non existence theorem for topological solitons/instantons. The
consequences of this result for the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories of
holographic QCD (on $I\!\!R^{5}$) are discussed.

**Abstract**: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would
be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it.
Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of
these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables,
namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the
electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the
statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in
a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the
decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and
spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$
and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and
110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay
events are detected.

**PDF Url**: [2505.11448v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11448v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we experimentally validate the dual use of a reconfigurable
photonic integrated mesh as a neuromorphic accelerator, targeting signal
equalization, and as a physical unclonable function offering authentication at
the hardware level. The processing node is an optical spectrum slicing
self-coherent transceiver targeting the mitigation of dispersion impairments of
an intensity detected QPSK signal, after 25 km of transmission at 32 Gbaud.
Unavoidable fabrication related imperfections of the nodes, such as waveguide
roughness, can act as fingerprints of the device, and, during neuromorphic
processing, result in unique weights at the digital back-end during signal
equalization. Extracted security metrics offer low false positive/negative
probability for the generated responses, confirming un-clonability, whereas
bit-error-ratio for the QPSK equalization task was always below the hardware
forward error correction limit. The experimental results substantiate the
capability of the proposed scheme to simultaneously act as an accelerator and
as a security token.


### Non-Perturbative Random Matrix Model of ${\cal N}=2$ JT Supergravity
**Authors**: Clifford V. Johnson

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2306.10139v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10139v4)

**Abstract**: It is shown how to non-perturbatively define a random matrix model that
captures key physics of ${\cal N}{=}2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) supergravity,
going well beyond the perturbative topological expansion defined recently by
Turiaci and Witten. A decomposition into an infinite family of certain
multicritical models is derived, leading to the definition of a non-linear
differential equation from which the physics may be computed. BPS states are
naturally described by the model. The non-perturbative completions of the
spectral densities for non-BPS multiplets are readily extracted.


### VideoHallu: Evaluating and Mitigating Multi-modal Hallucinations on Synthetic Video Understanding
**Authors**: Zongxia Li, Xiyang Wu, Guangyao Shi, Yubin Qin, Hongyang Du, Tianyi Zhou, Dinesh Manocha, Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber

**PDF Url**: [2505.01481v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01481v2)

**Abstract**: Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism
and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and
physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that
understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from
synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with
expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities
of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are
perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors.
VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples
across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA
MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and
VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world
benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic
physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show
that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using
curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive
commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves
MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of
targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical
laws.


### Inferring correlated distributions: boosted top jets

**PDF Url**: [2505.11438v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11438v1)

**Abstract**: Improving the understanding of signal and background distributions in
signal-region is a valuable key to enhance any analysis in collider physics.
This is usually a difficult task because -- among others -- signal and
backgrounds are hard to discriminate in signal-region, simulations may reach a
limit of reliability if they need to model non-perturbative QCD, and
distributions are multi-dimensional and many times may be correlated within
each class. Bayesian density estimation is a technique that leverages prior
knowledge and data correlations to effectively extract information from data in
signal-region. In this work we extend previous works on data-driven mixture
models for meaningful unsupervised signal extraction in collider physics to
incorporate correlations between features. Using a standard dataset of top and
QCD jets, we show how simulators, despite having an expected bias, can be used
to inject sufficient inductive nuance into an inference model in terms of
priors to then be corrected by data and estimate the true correlated
distributions between features within each class. We compare the model with and
without correlations to show how the signal extraction is sensitive to their
inclusion and we quantify the improvement due to the inclusion of correlations
using both supervised and unsupervised metrics.


### GODBench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Video Comment Art
**Authors**: Chenkai Zhang, Yiming Lei, Zeming Liu, Haitao Leng, Shaoguo Liu, Tingting Gao, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang

**PDF Url**: [2505.11436v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11436v1)

**Abstract**: Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that
conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and
comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated
strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they
still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and
insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their
limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of
comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these
limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and
text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment
Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we
propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to
enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing
MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and
generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective
approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive
meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity. GODBench is publicly
available at https://github.com/stan-lei/GODBench-ACL2025.


### Unified Quantum Dynamics: The Emergence of the Born Rule
**Authors**: Martin Weidner

**Published Date**: 2025-04-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2504.06495v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06495v2)

**Abstract**: While the Born rule is traditionally introduced as a separate postulate of
quantum mechanics, we show it emerges naturally from a modified Schr\"odinger
equation that includes "small-signal truncation". This parallels the way
quantum decoherence gives rise to the branches of the multiverse in the
"Many-Worlds Interpretation", eliminating the need for a separate measurement
postulate. Our approach thus offers a unified framework in which both the
emergence of multiple branches of the multiverse and their statistical
properties follow from a single fundamental law of motion. We model
"small-signal truncation" in a somewhat stylized manner, but we argue that the
precise details of its underlying physical mechanism do not affect the
emergence of the Born rule.


## Diffusion
### Fast and Robust Visuomotor Riemannian Flow Matching Policy
**Authors**: Haoran Ding, Noémie Jaquier, Jan Peters, Leonel Rozo

**Published Date**: 2024-12-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2412.10855v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10855v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at learning complex robotic tasks
by effectively combining visual data with high-dimensional, multi-modal action
distributions. However, diffusion models often suffer from slow inference due
to costly denoising processes or require complex sequential training arising
from recent distilling approaches. This paper introduces Riemannian Flow
Matching Policy (RFMP), a model that inherits the easy training and fast
inference capabilities of flow matching (FM). Moreover, RFMP inherently
incorporates geometric constraints commonly found in realistic robotic
applications, as the robot state resides on a Riemannian manifold. To enhance
the robustness of RFMP, we propose Stable RFMP (SRFMP), which leverages
LaSalle's invariance principle to equip the dynamics of FM with stability to
the support of a target Riemannian distribution. Rigorous evaluation on eight
simulated and real-world tasks show that RFMP successfully learns and
synthesizes complex sensorimotor policies on Euclidean and Riemannian spaces
with efficient training and inference phases, outperforming Diffusion Policies
and Consistency Policies.


### Exploratory Diffusion Model for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Chengyang Ying, Huayu Chen, Xinning Zhou, Zhongkai Hao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu

**Published Date**: 2025-02-11

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2502.07279v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07279v2)

**Abstract**: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to pre-train agents by
exploring diverse states or skills in reward-free environments, facilitating
efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. As the agent cannot access extrinsic
rewards during unsupervised exploration, existing methods design intrinsic
rewards to model the explored data and encourage further exploration. However,
the explored data are always heterogeneous, posing the requirements of powerful
representation abilities for both intrinsic reward models and pre-trained
policies. In this work, we propose the Exploratory Diffusion Model (ExDM),
which leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the
explored data, simultaneously boosting exploration and providing an efficient
initialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, ExDM can accurately estimate
the distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion
model and introduces the score-based intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to
explore less-visited states. After obtaining the pre-trained policies, ExDM
enables rapid adaptation to downstream tasks. In detail, we provide theoretical
analyses and practical algorithms for fine-tuning diffusion policies,
addressing key challenges such as training instability and computational
complexity caused by multi-step sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ExDM outperforms existing SOTA baselines in efficient unsupervised
exploration and fast fine-tuning downstream tasks, especially in structurally
complicated environments.


### A Generative Framework for Causal Estimation via Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation
**Authors**: Xinran Song, Tianyu Chen, Mingyuan Zhou

**Published Date**: 2025-05-16

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2505.11444v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11444v1)

**Abstract**: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data is a
central challenge in causal inference, largely due to covariate imbalance and
confounding bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. While inverse
probability weighting (IPW) is a well-established solution to this problem, its
integration into modern deep learning frameworks remains limited. In this work,
we propose Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation (IWDD), a novel
generative framework that combines the pretraining of diffusion models with
importance-weighted score distillation to enable accurate and fast causal
estimation-including potential outcome prediction and treatment effect
estimation. We demonstrate how IPW can be naturally incorporated into the
distillation of pretrained diffusion models, and further introduce a
randomization-based adjustment that eliminates the need to compute IPW
explicitly-thereby simplifying computation and, more importantly, provably
reducing the variance of gradient estimates. Empirical results show that IWDD
achieves state-of-the-art out-of-sample prediction performance, with the
highest win rates compared to other baselines, significantly improving causal
estimation and supporting the development of individualized treatment
strategies. We will release our PyTorch code for reproducibility and future
research.


### Diffusion Learning with Partial Agent Participation and Local Updates
**Authors**: Elsa Rizk, Kun Yuan, Ali H. Sayed

**Published Date**: 2025-05-16

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2505.11307v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11307v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion learning is a framework that endows edge devices with advanced
intelligence. By processing and analyzing data locally and allowing each agent
to communicate with its immediate neighbors, diffusion effectively protects the
privacy of edge devices, enables real-time response, and reduces reliance on
central servers. However, traditional diffusion learning relies on
communication at every iteration, leading to communication overhead, especially
with large learning models. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of edge
devices, stemming from power outages or signal loss, poses challenges to
reliable communication between neighboring agents. To mitigate these issues,
this paper investigates an enhanced diffusion learning approach incorporating
local updates and partial agent participation. Local updates will curtail
communication frequency, while partial agent participation will allow for the
inclusion of agents based on their availability. We prove that the resulting
algorithm is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide a tight analysis
of its Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) performance. Various numerical experiments
are conducted to illustrate our theoretical findings.


### Effective Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Adaptive Noise-Separated Diffusion
**Authors**: Xinyan Wang, Rui Dai, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu

**Published Date**: 2025-05-16

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-16

**PDF Url**: [2505.11306v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11306v1)

**Abstract**: We propose the Fourier Adaptive Lite Diffusion Architecture (FALDA), a novel
probabilistic framework for time series forecasting. First, we introduce the
Diffusion Model for Residual Regression (DMRR) framework, which unifies
diffusion-based probabilistic regression methods. Within this framework, FALDA
leverages Fourier-based decomposition to incorporate a component-specific
architecture, enabling tailored modeling of individual temporal components. A
conditional diffusion model is utilized to estimate the future noise term,
while our proposed lightweight denoiser, DEMA (Decomposition MLP with AdaLN),
conditions on the historical noise term to enhance denoising performance.
Through mathematical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that
FALDA effectively reduces epistemic uncertainty, allowing probabilistic
learning to primarily focus on aleatoric uncertainty. Experiments on six
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FALDA consistently outperforms existing
probabilistic forecasting approaches across most datasets for long-term time
series forecasting while achieving enhanced computational efficiency without
compromising accuracy. Notably, FALDA also achieves superior overall
performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point forecasting approaches,
with improvements of up to 9%.
