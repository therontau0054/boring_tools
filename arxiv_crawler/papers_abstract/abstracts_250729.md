**Abstract**: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter
that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising
model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase
emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and
(low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier
duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a
finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to
characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary
conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by
boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous
symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension
of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide
numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their
corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete
phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous)
intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate
transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.

**Abstract**: Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel
frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We
propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in
relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion
on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts
with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to
transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across
the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the
corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our
prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk
extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with
the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement
this prescription for holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on
both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski
space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical
properties of temporal entanglement.

**Abstract**: The Phase-Field Method (PFM) is employed to simulate two-phase flows with the
fully-coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations governing the
temporal evolution. The methodology minimizes the total energy functional,
accounting for diffusive and viscous dissipations. A new perspective is
presented by analyzing the interplay between kinetic energy, mixing energy, and
viscous dissipation using the temporal evolution of the total energy
functional. The classical surface energy is approximated with mixing energy
under specific conditions, and the accuracy of this substitution is rigorously
evaluated. The energy-based surface tension formulation derived from the
Korteweg stress tensor demonstrates exceptional accuracy in capturing
variations in the mixing energy. These concepts are demonstrated by considering
two benchmark problems: droplet oscillation and capillary thread breakup. Key
findings include validating mixing-energy theory for highly deformed
interfaces, as well as the discovery of distinct energy dissipation patterns
during thread breakup and droplet oscillations. The results highlight the
robustness of the free energy-based PFM in accurately capturing complex
interfacial dynamics, while maintaining energy conservation.

**Abstract**: Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and
characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations
of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in
continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems
were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number
fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a
combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data
using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid
approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master
equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous
fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm
BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent
around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute
to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the
importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on
fundamental quantum mechanical properties.


### The LHC as a TeV Muon Beam Dump: Muonphilic Scalars at FASER
**Authors**: Roshan Mammen Abraham, Max Fieg

**Published Date**: 2025-01-15

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2501.09071v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09071v2)

**Abstract**: The FASER experiment was designed to study long-lived dark sector particles
and neutrinos traveling in the forward direction at the LHC. Neutrinos are
predominantly produced from meson decays, which also result in an intense
energetic flux of muons in the forward direction regularly observed by FASER.
So far, these muons are treated only as backgrounds to neutrino and new physics
studies, and extensive effort is required to suppress them. In this study, we
consider the opposite scenario and use muons produced in the forward direction
to produce new muonphilic scalars, which can then be searched for at the FASER
detector. To minimize the backgrounds for this search, we make use of an
upgraded preshower component, which is expected to be installed at FASER before
the end of Run 3, and is capable of spatially resolving two energetic photons.
We find that FASER, and its upgrade, FASER2 can probe currently unconstrained
regions of parameter space, including regions that can potentially explain the
$(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly. This highlights the physics opportunities that the
intense TeV muon beam at the LHC can bring.


### Assessing cosmological evidence for non-minimal coupling

**Abstract**: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark
Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark
energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field
$\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess
the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the
accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential
energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2<0$.
Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field
that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm
0.6$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological
scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we
do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into
play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation
for the observed cosmic acceleration.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced
reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile,
physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world
understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper
introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems
spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.
Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through
a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics
domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern
Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to
graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and
evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset
into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful
reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In
addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks
exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in
physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model
evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations
of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset
and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the
field of physics.


### New Physics contamination to precision luminosity measurements at future $e^+e^-$ colliders
**Authors**: Mauro Chiesa, Clara L. Del Pio, Guido Montagna, Oreste Nicrosini, Fulvio Piccinini, Francesco P. Ucci

**Published Date**: 2025-01-09

**PDF Url**: [2501.05256v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05256v2)

**Abstract**: Several key observables of the high-precision physics program at future
lepton colliders will critically depend on the knowledge of the absolute
machine luminosity. The determination of the luminosity relies on the precise
knowledge of some reference process, which is in principle not affected by
unknown physics, so that its cross section can be computed within a
well-established theory, like the Standard Model. Quantifying the uncertainties
induced by possible New Physics effects on such processes is therefore crucial.
We present an exploratory investigation of light and heavy New Physics
contributions to the small-angle Bhabha process at future $e^+e^-$ colliders
and we discuss possible strategies to remove potential uncertainties
originating from such contaminations by relying on observables that are
independent of the absolute luminosity.


### Maximal intrinsic randomness of noisy quantum measurements
**Authors**: Fionnuala Curran, Morteza Moradi, Gabriel Senno, Magdalena Stobinska, Antonio Acín

**Published Date**: 2025-06-27

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2506.22294v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22294v2)

**Abstract**: Quantum physics exhibits an intrinsic and private form of randomness with no
classical counterpart. Any setup for quantum randomness generation involves
measurements acting on quantum states. In this work, we consider the following
question: Given a quantum measurement, how much randomness can be generated
from it? In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional,
extrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not
private since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side
information held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement
outcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing
probability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input
states. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here
for any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in
arbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given
measured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy
state and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement
and (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an
eavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.


### Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances
**Authors**: Abhay Ashtekar, Badri Krishnan

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2502.11825v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11825v3)

**Abstract**: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons,
subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them
unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum
gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been
steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology.
In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought'
only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local
horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing
powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs.
They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen
insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result
that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in
the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical
processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting
correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those
defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is
naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This
review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical
general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.


## Diffusion
### Flow Matching Policy Gradients
**Authors**: David McAllister, Songwei Ge, Brent Yi, Chung Min Kim, Ethan Weber, Hongsuk Choi, Haiwen Feng, Angjoo Kanazawa

**Published Date**: 2025-07-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2507.21053v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21053v1)

**Abstract**: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.


### Transformers as Unrolled Inference in Probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps: An Interpretation and Potential Improvements
**Authors**: Aditya Ravuri, Neil D. Lawrence

**Published Date**: 2025-07-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2507.21040v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21040v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.


### JWB-DH-V1: Benchmark for Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version 1
**Authors**: Xinhan Di, Kristin Qi, Pengqian Yu

**Published Date**: 2025-07-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2507.20987v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20987v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.
The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at

### Model-Agnostic Gender Bias Control for Text-to-Image Generation via Sparse Autoencoder
**Authors**: Chao Wu, Zhenyi Wang, Kangxian Xie, Naresh Kumar Devulapally, Vishnu Suresh Lokhande, Mingchen Gao

**Published Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2507.20973v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20973v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.


### Mean-Field Langevin Diffusions with Density-dependent Temperature
**Authors**: Yu-Jui Huang, Zachariah Malik

**Published Date**: 2025-07-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2507.20958v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20958v1)

**Abstract**: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a
Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The
rationale is that the induced density reveals to some extent the landscape
imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a
density-dependent temperature can provide location-wise random perturbation
that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local
minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density,
it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii
type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on
Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding
(nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution
to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by
Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show
that the density induced by the SDE converges to an invariant distribution,
which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function.


## Quantitative Finance
### Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis
**Authors**: Hoyoung Lee, Junhyuk Seo, Suhwan Park, Junhyeong Lee, Wonbin Ahn, Chanyeol Choi, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Yongjae Lee

**Published Date**: 2025-07-28

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-28

**PDF Url**: [2507.20957v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20957v1)

**Abstract**: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.
