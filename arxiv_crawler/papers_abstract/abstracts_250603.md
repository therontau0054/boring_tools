**Abstract**: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms,
leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of
an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time
required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or
more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both
efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the
geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the
Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap,
facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive
effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling
experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This
approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard
geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled
states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our
findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in
ultracold atomic systems.

**Abstract**: Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about
their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic
games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without
heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by
each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which
admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and
through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing
rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based
estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We
also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on
individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and
warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more
complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating
evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.

**Authors**: Michael Q. May, Hong Qin

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01895v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01895v1)

**Abstract**: The Vlasov-Poisson equations, fundamental in plasma physics and astrophysical
applications, are rendered linear, finite-dimensional, and discrete by second
quantization. Conditions for correspondence between the pre-quantized and
quantized equations are derived, and numerical simulations demonstrating the
quantized linear system can capture nonlinear dynamics are presented. Finally,
encouraging scaling relations emphasizing the prospect of using quantum
computers to efficiently integrate the second quantized Vlasov-Poisson
equations as a model for the usual Vlasov-Poisson equations are derived.

**Authors**: Giuseppe Bozzi, Matthias Schott

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01887v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01887v1)

**Abstract**: A precise determination of the W boson mass is an essential test for the
Standard Model of particle physics: the comparison of experimental value and
theoretical prediction allows to probe the internal consistency of the
electroweak sector and could possibly highlight signals of New Physics. We
provide a concise and up-to-date summary of past and recent measurements at
lepton and hadron colliders, a discussion of the known perturbative and
non-perturbative theoretical ingredients used to provide predictions for the
relevant observables, and an overview of future prospects to reduce systematic
uncertainties and to compare different measurements in a consistent way. We
conclude with a brief discussion on the relevance of the global electroweak fit
at present and future colliders.

**PDF Url**: [2506.01882v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01882v1)

**Abstract**: The characterization of Hamiltonians and other components of open quantum
dynamical systems plays a crucial role in quantum computing and other
applications. Scientific machine learning techniques have been applied to this
problem in a variety of ways, including by modeling with deep neural networks.
However, the majority of mathematical models describing open quantum systems
are linear, and the natural nonlinearities in learnable models have not been
incorporated using physical principles. We present a data-driven model for open
quantum systems that includes learnable, thermodynamically consistent terms.
The trained model is interpretable, as it directly estimates the system
Hamiltonian and linear components of coupling to the environment. We validate
the model on synthetic two and three-level data, as well as experimental
two-level data collected from a quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.

**Abstract**: Precise radiation delivery is critical for effective radiotherapy, and gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance local dose
deposition while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. In this study, the
PENELOPE Monte Carlo code was used to investigate the dosimetry of AuNPs under
different conditions and models. The Dose Enhancement Ratio (DER) was studied
in water and breast tissue with spherical shapes and in agreement with
previously published results. To further analyse the physical interactions of
the particles around the AuNP, a Phase Space File (PSF) in a volume around the
AuNPs was created. This showed that larger AuNPs lead to increased doses, as
expected, yielding DER values exceeding 100 times. Finally, results reveal that
in the volume surrounding the AuNP, 80% of emitted electrons originate from
photoelectric absorption, leading to Auger electron emission cascades which
were analysed in detail. It was also possible to establish a direct relation
between number of secondaries and the particle volumes. The Local Effect Model
(LEM) was used to determine survival curves in AuNPs of different sizes at
different gold concentrations. The last part of this work consisted in
analysing a distribution of AuNPs within a flattened cell typical of clonogenic
assays where a log-normal distribution of dose was observed. This led to the
development of a new, mechanistic, Local Effect Model which, if further
validated, can have further applications in-vitro and in-silico.

**Authors**: Chengbing Chen, Yutong Li, Rui Zhao, Zhoulin Liu, Zheyong Fan, Gang Tang, Zhiyong Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01868v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01868v1)

**Abstract**: As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method
features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied
in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial
for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of
NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work,
we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing
and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while
automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that
features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove
non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring
high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI)
software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing
functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration.
It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point
sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection.
The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more
efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we
demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and
further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe
this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning
interatomic potentials.


### Modeling the Optical Properties of Biological Structures using Symbolic Regression
**Authors**: Julian Sierra-Velez, Alexandre Vial, Marina Inchaussandague, Diana Skigin, Demetrio Macías

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01862v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01862v1)

**Abstract**: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to
derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral
data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological
materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case
studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that
constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show
that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous
dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their
algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the
dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.


### A Quantum-Inspired Conceptual Model of Collective Subjective Evaluation via Bloch Sphere Dynamics and Like-Polarization
**Authors**: Bumned Soodchomshom

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01847v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01847v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a conceptual quantum-inspired model to describe subjective
evaluation processes such as taste testing or consumer preference
scoring-through the continuous time evolution of cognitive states represented
on the Bloch sphere. Unlike conventional quantum cognition models that rely on
projective measurements and state collapse, our framework treats evaluation as
a weak or generalized measurement, preserving quantum coherence during the act
of judgment. The mental state of preference is modeled as a coherent
superposition in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, with time evolution governed
by a stimulus-dependent Hamiltonian H(t), which reflects the sensory or
motivational impact of external input. The observed score (e.g., 0 to 10)
corresponds to the squared amplitude projected onto the "like" basis without
collapsing the underlying state. For group-level analysis, we introduce a novel
metric called "like-polarization", analogous to spin polarization, which
quantifies the collective orientation of preferences. This model provides a
physically motivated alternative to classical evaluation theories, offering
insights into the reversibility, context-dependence, and temporal dynamics of
human judgment. It further enables applications in behavioral science,
affective computing, and the design of human-centered AI systems.


### INVARLLM: LLM-assisted Physical Invariant Extraction for Cyber-Physical Systems Anomaly Detection
**Authors**: Danial Abshari, Peiran Shi, Chenglong Fu, Meera Sridhar, Xiaojiang Du

**Published Date**: 2024-11-17

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2411.10918v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10918v2)

**Abstract**: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks that
violate physical laws. While invariant-based anomaly detection is effective,
existing methods are limited: data-driven approaches lack semantic context, and
physics-based models require extensive manual work. We propose INVARLLM, a
hybrid framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract semantic
information from CPS documentation and generate physical invariants, then
validates these against real system data using a PCMCI+-inspired K-means
method. This approach combines LLM semantic understanding with empirical
validation to ensure both interpretability and reliability. We evaluate
INVARLLM on SWaT and WADI datasets, achieving 100% precision in anomaly
detection with no false alarms, outperforming all existing methods. Our results
demonstrate that integrating LLM-derived semantics with statistical validation
provides a scalable and dependable solution for CPS security.


## Diffusion
### VARD: Efficient and Dense Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Models with Value-based RL
**Authors**: Fengyuan Dai, Zifeng Zhuang, Yufei Huang, Siteng Huang, Bangyan Liao, Donglin Wang, Fajie Yuan

**Published Date**: 2025-05-21

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2505.15791v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15791v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various
domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable
properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable,
efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore,
their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during
intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To
address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required
throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced
Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function
predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses
this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision
throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the
pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via
backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates
better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the
applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex,
non-differentiable reward functions.


### Image Generation from Contextually-Contradictory Prompts
**Authors**: Saar Huberman, Or Patashnik, Omer Dahary, Ron Mokady, Daniel Cohen-Or

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01929v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01929v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse
images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce
semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations
that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual
contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled
associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware
prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a
sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the
semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while
ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a
large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify
contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original
intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information
with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic
control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual
contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show
substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.


### Esoteric Language Models

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01928v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01928v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation.
Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the
strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack
key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work,
we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms,
enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their
respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language
modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for
MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference
efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves
up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference
than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model
checkpoints on the project page:

### TaxaDiffusion: Progressively Trained Diffusion Model for Fine-Grained Species Generation
**Authors**: Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mridul Khurana, Rajiv Ramnath, Anuj Karpatne, Wei-Lun Chao, Cheng Zhang

**Published Date**: 2025-06-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2506.01923v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01923v1)

**Abstract**: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for
diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological
and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an
independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many
species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in
subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,
TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across
different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class
and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at
the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures
coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,
facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for
species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate
generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive
experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms
existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image
generation. Project page: https://amink8.github.io/TaxaDiffusion/


### Certified Robustness to Clean-Label Poisoning Using Diffusion Denoising
**Authors**: Sanghyun Hong, Nicholas Carlini, Alexey Kurakin

**Published Date**: 2024-03-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-06-02

**PDF Url**: [2403.11981v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11981v2)

**Abstract**: We present a certified defense to clean-label poisoning attacks under
$\ell_2$-norm. These attacks work by injecting a small number of poisoning
samples (e.g., 1%) that contain bounded adversarial perturbations into the
training data to induce a targeted misclassification of a test-time input.
Inspired by the adversarial robustness achieved by $randomized$ $smoothing$, we
show how an off-the-shelf diffusion denoising model can sanitize the tampered
training data. We extensively test our defense against seven clean-label
poisoning attacks in both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$-norms and reduce their
attack success to 0-16% with only a negligible drop in the test accuracy. We
compare our defense with existing countermeasures against clean-label
poisoning, showing that the defense reduces the attack success the most and
offers the best model utility. Our results highlight the need for future work
on developing stronger clean-label attacks and using our certified yet
practical defense as a strong baseline to evaluate these attacks.

### Advanced simulation paradigm of human behaviour unveils complex financial systemic projection
**Authors**: Cheng Wang, Chuwen Wang, Shirong Zeng, Jianguo Liu, Changjun Jiang

**Published Date**: 2025-02-18

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-31

**PDF Url**: [2503.20787v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20787v2)

**Abstract**: The high-order complexity of human behaviour is likely the root cause of
extreme difficulty in financial market projections. We consider that
behavioural simulation can unveil systemic dynamics to support analysis.
Simulating diverse human groups must account for the behavioural heterogeneity,
especially in finance. To address the fidelity of simulated agents, on the
basis of agent-based modeling, we propose a new paradigm of behavioural
simulation where each agent is supported and driven by a hierarchical knowledge
architecture. This architecture, integrating language and professional models,
imitates behavioural processes in specific scenarios. Evaluated on futures
markets, our simulator achieves a 13.29% deviation in simulating crisis
scenarios whose price increase rate reaches 285.34%. Under normal conditions,
our simulator also exhibits lower mean square error in predicting futures price
of specific commodities. This technique bridges non-quantitative information
with diverse market behaviour, offering a promising platform to simulate
investor behaviour and its impact on market dynamics.
