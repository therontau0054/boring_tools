**Abstract**: The discovery of nontrivial topology in quantum critical states has
introduced a new paradigm for classifying quantum phase transitions and
challenges the conventional belief that topological phases are typically
associated with a bulk energy gap. However, realizing and characterizing such
topologically nontrivial quantum critical states with large particle numbers
remains an outstanding experimental challenge in statistical and condensed
matter physics. Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and
manipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for
exploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental
exploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying
critical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We
develop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on
prepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial
topology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the
entanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold
topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary
condition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence
in topological critical systems. Our results demonstrate the low-lying critical
states as useful quantum resources for investigating the interplay between
topology and quantum criticality.

**Abstract**: The four-roll mill has been traditionally viewed as a device generating
simple extensional flow with a central stagnation point. Our systematic
investigation using a two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann
(TRT-RLB) model reveals unexpected richness in the flow physics, identifying
two previously unreported supercritical bifurcation modes: a quadrifoliate
vortex mode featuring four symmetrical counter-rotating vortices, and a
dumbbell-shaped quad-vortex mode where vortices detach from but remain
symmetric about the stagnation point. The numerical framework, representing the
first successful extension of TRT-RLB method to power-law fluid dynamics,
enables comprehensive mapping of flow characteristics across Reynolds numbers
($1 \leq Re \leq 50$), power-law indices ($0.7 \leq n \leq 1.3$), and geometric
configurations. The transition from quadrifoliate vortex mode exhibits distinct
pathways depending on the power-law index: at relatively small $n$, the flow
undergoes a direct supercritical bifurcation to simple extensional flow, while
at relatively large $n$, it evolves through an intermediate dumbbell-shaped
state. Among geometric parameters, the roller radius $r$ emerges as the
dominant factor controlling bifurcation points and vortex dimensions, whereas
the roller-container gap $\delta$ exerts minimal influence on flow regimes. The
transitions between flow modes can be precisely characterized through the
evolution of vortex dimensions and velocity gradients at the stagnation point,
providing quantitative criteria for flow regime identification. These findings
enrich our fundamental understanding of bifurcation phenomena in extensional
devices and provide quantitative guidelines for achieving desired flow patterns
in four-roll mill applications.

**Abstract**: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb}
\rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon
with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using
QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector
and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full
theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction
of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the
exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present
and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply
heavy baryons.

**Abstract**: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the
inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d
triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical
check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide
a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our
method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing
random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the
corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles,
and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these
couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift
an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and
establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our
numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric
formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected,
in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.


### Fast physics-based launcher optimization for electron cyclotron current drive

**Abstract**: With the increased urgency to design fusion pilot plants, fast optimization
of electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) launchers is paramount.
Traditionally, this is done by coarsely sampling the 4-D parameter space of
possible launch conditions consisting of (1) the launch location (constrained
to lie along the reactor vessel), (2) the launch frequency, (3) the toroidal
launch angle, and (4) the poloidal launch angle. For each initial condition, a
ray-tracing simulation is performed to evaluate the ECCD efficiency.
Unfortunately, this approach often requires millions of simulations to build up
a dataset that adequately covers the plasma volume, which must then be repeated
every time the design point changes. Here we adopt a different approach. Rather
than launching rays from the plasma periphery and hoping for the best, we
instead directly reconstruct the optimal ray for driving current at a given
flux surface using a reduced physics model coupled with a commercial
ray-tracing code. Repeating this throughout the plasma volume requires only
hundreds of simulations, constituting a ten-thousand-fold speedup. The new
method is validated on two separate example tokamak profiles, and is shown to
reliably drive localized current at the specified flux surface with the same
optimal efficiency as obtained from the traditional approach.


### Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion

**Abstract**: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion
models under the manifold hypothesis. For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum
of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function,
whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct
sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral
distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional
assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra
estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three
distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a
manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution
internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes
orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of
the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an
elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the
manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the
internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time
points during generation.

**Abstract**: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined
geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic
deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle.
In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine
this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the
pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a
microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of
confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the
force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above
ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow
considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a
single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights
by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.

**Abstract**: The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces immense volumes of complex data
from high-energy particle collisions, demanding sophisticated analytical
techniques for effective interpretation. Neural Networks, including Graph
Neural Networks, have shown promise in tasks such as event classification and
object identification by representing collisions as graphs. However, while
Graph Neural Networks excel in predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature
often limits their interpretability, making it difficult to trust their
decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
combines a Graph Transformer model with Mixture-of-Expert layers to achieve
high predictive performance while embedding interpretability into the
architecture. By leveraging attention maps and expert specialization, the model
offers insights into its internal decision-making, linking predictions to
physics-informed features. We evaluate the model on simulated events from the
ATLAS experiment, focusing on distinguishing rare Supersymmetric signal events
from Standard Model background. Our results highlight that the model achieves
competitive classification accuracy while providing interpretable outputs that
align with known physics, demonstrating its potential as a robust and
transparent tool for high-energy physics data analysis. This approach
underscores the importance of explainability in machine learning methods
applied to high energy physics, offering a path toward greater trust in
AI-driven discoveries.

**Abstract**: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated
physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century.
This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the
MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early
developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational
interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the
groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis
proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence
of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the
evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent
physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on
contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory
and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the
MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights
into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its
implications for our understanding of the universe.


### Monotonicity of the Relative Entropy and the Two-sided Bogoliubov Inequality in von Neumann Algebras

**Abstract**: This text studies, on the one hand, certain monotonicity properties of the
Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy and, on the other hand, unbounded perturbation
theory of KMS-states which facilitates a proof of the two-sided Bogoliubov
inequality in general von Neumann algebras. After introducing the necessary
background from the theory of operator algebras and Tomita-Takesaki modular
theory, the relative entropy functional is defined and its basic properties are
studied. In particular, a full and detailed proof of Uhlmann's important
monotonicity theorem for the relative entropy is provided. This theorem will
then be used to derive a number of monotonicity inequalities for the relative
entropy of normal functionals induced by vectors of the form $V \varOmega, V
\varPhi \in \mathcal{H}$, where $V \in \mathscr{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a suitable
transformation. After that, an introduction to perturbation theory in von
Neumann algebras is given, with an emphasis on unbounded perturbations of
KMS-states following the framework of Derezi\'{n}ski-Jak\v{s}i\'{c}-Pillet.
This mathematical apparatus will then be used to extend the two-sided
Bogoliubov inequality for the relative free energy, which was very recently
proved for quantum-mechanical systems, to arbitrary von Neumann algebras.

**Abstract**: Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective
general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities --
including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation.
For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely
on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot
policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions
solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose
FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies
on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily
available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We
combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language
generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot
manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that
require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a
zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal
prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same
recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both
diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA)
models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to
increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.

**Abstract**: Multi-modal generative AI systems, such as those combining vision and
language, rely on contrastive pre-training to learn representations across
different modalities. While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a
rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework
remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the
success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot
classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We
introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of
the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the
contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them
adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative
Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that
transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model
via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity
guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained
representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings,
demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively
pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing medical practice, enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and healthcare delivery. However, its adaptation in medical
settings still faces significant challenges, related to data availability and
privacy constraints. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate these issues, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy.
Recently, Latent Diffusion Models have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating high-quality synthetic data. Meanwhile, the integration of different
modalities has gained interest, emphasizing the need of models capable of
handle multimodal medical data.Existing approaches struggle to integrate
complementary information and lack the ability to generate modalities
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we present MedCoDi-M, a
6.77-billion-parameter model, designed for multimodal medical data generation,
that, following Foundation Model paradigm, exploits contrastive learning and
large quantity of data to build a shared latent space which capture the
relationships between different data modalities. Further, we introduce the
Multi-Prompt training technique, which significantly boosts MedCoDi-M's
generation under different settings. We extensively validate MedCoDi-M: first
we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a
state-of-the-art dataset for Chest X-ray and radiological report generation.
Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess
the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment
with real-world scenarios. Finally, we assess the utility of MedCoDi-M in
addressing key challenges in the medical field, such as anonymization, data
scarcity and imbalance learning. The results are promising, demonstrating the
applicability of MedCoDi-M in medical contexts. Project page is at
