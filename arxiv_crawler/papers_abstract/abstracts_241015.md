**Abstract**: We explore the most general phenomenology of charged lepton flavor violating
(CLFV) decays of muon and tau leptons to the three body final states
$(\bar{e}ee, \bar{\mu}\mu\mu, \bar{e}\mu\mu, \bar{\mu}\mu e,\bar{\mu}ee,
\bar{e}e\mu)$. By constructing a complete basis of operators at each dimension,
we derive the most general amplitudes for these decay processes. By considering
constraints from unitarity and LEP, we show that operators of mass dimension 6
and 7 are the most likely to be observed in next generation experiments.
Focusing on these dimensions, we compute the results of unpolarized
(spin-averaged) decays parameterized in terms of the invariant masses of the
daughter particles. For the $\mu \rightarrow \bar{e}ee$ decay, we also compute
the differential decay rate for polarized decays, in anticipation of the
experimental search Mu3e, which expects to have a muon beam with $\sim 90\%$
polarization. To determine the extent to which the operators may be
distinguished experimentally, we plot the differential distributions for each
operator, showing that the differential distributions leave only a few possible
degenerate explanations. These results are adapted to treat $\ell\to \ell' \nu
\bar{\nu}$, where the angular distribution of the outgoing charged lepton has
enhanced distinguishing power. With many Standard Model extensions predicting
these CLFV decays, these results will better enable upcoming searches to
identify and/or constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.

**Authors**: Youwei Yu, Junhong Xu, Lantao Liu

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-14

**Abstract**: Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for
developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex
and unstructured terrains. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two
essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to
expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting
sufficiently challenging yet attainable terrains to facilitate continuous
policy improvement. Existing methods of environment generation often rely on
heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and
realism. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator
(ADTG), a novel method that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and
complex terrains adaptive to the current policy. ADTG guides the diffusion
model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending
noise-corrupted terrains from existing training environments weighted by the
policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the
noise corruption level, ADTG seamlessly transitions between generating similar
terrains for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity.
Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADTG outperforms both
procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation
methods.

**PDF Url**: [2410.10764v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10764v1)

**Abstract**: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) are promising for spintronics,
leveraging strong spin-orbit coupling for efficient spin manipulation via
electrical and optical methods, with potential applications in memory storage,
quantum computing, and spin-based logic. While the Kane-Mele model effectively
captures the low-energy physics of these materials, the impact of perturbations
driving phase transitions is less well understood. Developing approaches to
describe these phases is crucial. Here, we study the noncollinear
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic
impurities in a \textit{perturbed} Kane-Mele model with strong spin-orbit
coupling, relevant to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ as a prominent
QSHI. By analyzing RKKY interactions, we reveal distinct, relative (rather than
absolute) signatures of the different phase transitions induced by static and
dynamic perturbations based on their impact on magnetic impurities. We then
employ these perturbations to switch between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic or clockwise and counterclockwise magnetic interactions for
control processes. Our results offer a practical way to track topological
phases via magnetic properties.

**Authors**: Robert McCarthy, Daniel C. H. Tan, Dominik Schmidt, Fernando Acero, Nathan Herr, Yilun Du, Thomas G. Thuruthel, Zhibin Li

**PDF Url**: [2404.19664v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19664v3)

**Abstract**: Scaling deep learning to huge internet-scraped datasets has yielded
remarkably general capabilities in natural language processing and visual
understanding and generation. In contrast, data is scarce and expensive to
collect in robotics. This has seen robot learning struggle to match the
generality of capabilities observed in other domains. Learning from Videos
(LfV) methods seek to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional
robot data with large internet-scraped video datasets. Such video data may
provide the model with foundational information regarding physical behaviours
and the physics of the world. This holds great promise for improving the
generality of our robots.
  In this survey, we present an overview of the emerging field of LfV. We
outline fundamental concepts, including the benefits and challenges of LfV. We
provide a comprehensive review of current methods for: extracting knowledge
from large-scale internet video; tackling key LfV challenges; and boosting
downstream reinforcement and robot learning via the use of video data. LfV
datasets and benchmarks are also reviewed. The survey closes with a critical
discussion of challenges and opportunities. Here, we advocate for scalable
foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available
internet video to aid the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. We
hope this survey can inform and catalyse further LfV research, facilitating
progress towards the development of general-purpose robots.


### SensorBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Coding-Based Sensor Processing
**Authors**: Pengrui Quan, Xiaomin Ouyang, Jeya Vikranth Jeyakumar, Ziqi Wang, Yang Xing, Mani Srivastava

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2410.10741v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10741v1)

**Abstract**: Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data have
emerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems. Traditionally,
processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency
in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language
Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data,
suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems.
  To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark,
SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates
diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that
while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face
inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections
compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting
strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform
all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive
benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward
an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.

**Authors**: Yuqi Wang, Ke Cheng, Jiawei He, Qitai Wang, Hengchen Dai, Yuntao Chen, Fei Xia, Zhaoxiang Zhang

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2410.10738v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10738v1)

**Abstract**: Driving world models have gained increasing attention due to their ability to
model complex physical dynamics. However, their superb modeling capability is
yet to be fully unleashed due to the limited video diversity in current driving
datasets. We introduce DrivingDojo, the first dataset tailor-made for training
interactive world models with complex driving dynamics. Our dataset features
video clips with a complete set of driving maneuvers, diverse multi-agent
interplay, and rich open-world driving knowledge, laying a stepping stone for
future world model development. We further define an action instruction
following (AIF) benchmark for world models and demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed dataset for generating action-controlled future predictions.

**Abstract**: The inherent sensitivity of quantum sensors to their physical environment can
make them good reporters of parameters such as temperature, pressure, strain,
and electric fields. Here, we present a molecular platform for pressure (P) and
temperature (T) sensing using para-terphenyl crystals doped with pentacene. We
leverage the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of the photoexcited
triplet electron in the pentacene molecule, that serves as a sensitive probe
for lattice changes in the host para-terphenyl due to pressure or temperature
variations. We observe maximal ODMR frequency variations of df/dP=1.8 MHz/bar
and df/dT=247 kHz/K, which are over 1,200 times and three times greater,
respectively, than those seen in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. This
results in a >85-fold improvement in pressure sensitivity over best previously
reported. The larger variation reflects the weaker nature of the para-terphenyl
lattice, with first-principles DFT calculations indicating that even
picometer-level shifts in the molecular orbitals due to P, T changes are
measurable. The platform offers additional advantages including high levels of
sensor doping, narrow ODMR linewidths and high contrasts, and ease of
deployment, leveraging the ability for large single crystals at low cost.
Overall, this work paves the way for low-cost, optically-interrogated pressure
and temperature sensors and lays the foundation for even more versatile sensors
enabled by synthetic tunability in designer molecular systems.

**Abstract**: Chirality, the breaking of improper rotational symmetry, is a fundamental
concept spanning diverse scientific domains. In condensed matter physics,
chiral phonons, originating from circular atomic motions that carry angular
momentum, have sparked intense interest due to their coupling to magnetic
degrees of freedom, enabling potential phonon-controlled spintronics. However,
modes and their counter-rotating counterparts are typically degenerate at the
Brillouin zone center. Selective excitation of a single-handed circulating
phonon requires external stimuli that break the degeneracy. Whether
energetically nondegenerate circularly polarized phonons can appear
spontaneously without structural or external symmetry breaking remains an open
question. Here, we demonstrate that nondegenerate elliptically polarized phonon
pairs can be induced by coupling to magnons with same helicity in the van der
Waals antiferromagnet $\mathrm{FePSe_3}$. We confirm the presence of
magnon-phonon hybrids, also known as magnon polarons, which exhibit inherent
elliptical polarization with opposite helicities and distinct energies. This
nondegeneracy enables their coherent excitation with linearly polarized
terahertz pulses, which also endows these rotating modes with chirality. By
tuning the polarization of the terahertz drive and measuring phase-resolved
polarimetry of the resulting coherent oscillations, we determine the
ellipticity and map the trajectory of these hybrid quasiparticles. Our findings
establish a general approach to search for intrinsically nondegenerate phonons
with angular momentum at the center of the Brillouin zone and introduce a new
methodology for characterizing their ellipticity, outlining a roadmap towards
chiral-phonon-controlled spintronic functionalities.

**Authors**: Md Shoyib Hassan, Syed Emad Uddin Shubha, M. R. C Mahdy

**PDF Url**: [2408.07997v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07997v5)

**Abstract**: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum
entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any
physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on
superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average
energy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob.
In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the
energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state
Hamiltonian H to achieve this, which conforms to the constraints of Zero mean
energy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of
the senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant
improvement in terms of energy retrieval. Though the Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) model demonstrates a similar result achieving an average
efficiency of 32.5% (observing only V ), the Single-Input Multiple-Output
(SIMO) model shows a significantly higher result than that of the 2-qubit
system considering practical usage, which is 58.2%


### Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states
**Authors**: Yangrui Hu, Yijian Zou

**Published Date**: 2024-08-01

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2408.00857v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00857v3)

**Abstract**: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$,
the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the
erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is
upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we
study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant
long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of
quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions,
(ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states
under local measurements. We find that the averaged infidelity of the Petz map
recovery sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are
distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is
characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We
also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational
interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates
that recovery fidelity of the Petz map is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases
of matter.

### Depth Any Video with Scalable Synthetic Data
**Authors**: Honghui Yang, Di Huang, Wei Yin, Chunhua Shen, Haifeng Liu, Xiaofei He, Binbin Lin, Wanli Ouyang, Tong He

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2410.10815v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10815v1)

**Abstract**: Video depth estimation has long been hindered by the scarcity of consistent
and scalable ground truth data, leading to inconsistent and unreliable results.
In this paper, we introduce Depth Any Video, a model that tackles the challenge
through two key innovations. First, we develop a scalable synthetic data
pipeline, capturing real-time video depth data from diverse synthetic
environments, yielding 40,000 video clips of 5-second duration, each with
precise depth annotations. Second, we leverage the powerful priors of
generative video diffusion models to handle real-world videos effectively,
integrating advanced techniques such as rotary position encoding and flow
matching to further enhance flexibility and efficiency. Unlike previous models,
which are limited to fixed-length video sequences, our approach introduces a
novel mixed-duration training strategy that handles videos of varying lengths
and performs robustly across different frame rates-even on single frames. At
inference, we propose a depth interpolation method that enables our model to
infer high-resolution video depth across sequences of up to 150 frames. Our
model outperforms all previous generative depth models in terms of spatial
accuracy and temporal consistency.


### HART: Efficient Visual Generation with Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer
**Authors**: Haotian Tang, Yecheng Wu, Shang Yang, Enze Xie, Junsong Chen, Junyu Chen, Zhuoyang Zhang, Han Cai, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2410.10812v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10812v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer (HART), an autoregressive (AR)
visual generation model capable of directly generating 1024x1024 images,
rivaling diffusion models in image generation quality. Existing AR models face
limitations due to the poor image reconstruction quality of their discrete
tokenizers and the prohibitive training costs associated with generating 1024px
images. To address these challenges, we present the hybrid tokenizer, which
decomposes the continuous latents from the autoencoder into two components:
discrete tokens representing the big picture and continuous tokens representing
the residual components that cannot be represented by the discrete tokens. The
discrete component is modeled by a scalable-resolution discrete AR model, while
the continuous component is learned with a lightweight residual diffusion
module with only 37M parameters. Compared with the discrete-only VAR tokenizer,
our hybrid approach improves reconstruction FID from 2.11 to 0.30 on MJHQ-30K,
leading to a 31% generation FID improvement from 7.85 to 5.38. HART also
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both FID and CLIP score, with
4.5-7.7x higher throughput and 6.9-13.4x lower MACs. Our code is open sourced
at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/hart.


### TrajDiffuse: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Environment-Aware Trajectory Prediction
**Authors**: Qingze, Liu, Danrui Li, Samuel S. Sohn, Sejong Yoon, Mubbasir Kapadia, Vladimir Pavlovic

**PDF Url**: [2410.10804v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10804v1)

**Abstract**: Accurate prediction of human or vehicle trajectories with good diversity that
captures their stochastic nature is an essential task for many applications.
However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectory
samples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting other
key requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment.
In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction
method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory
prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance
term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory
predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while
adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the
utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and
provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.


### Generalizable Humanoid Manipulation with Improved 3D Diffusion Policies

**Abstract**: Humanoid robots capable of autonomous operation in diverse environments have
long been a goal for roboticists. However, autonomous manipulation by humanoid
robots has largely been restricted to one specific scene, primarily due to the
difficulty of acquiring generalizable skills. Recent advances in 3D visuomotor
policies, such as the 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), have shown promise in
extending these capabilities to wilder environments. However, 3D visuomotor
policies often rely on camera calibration and point-cloud segmentation, which
present challenges for deployment on mobile robots like humanoids. In this
work, we introduce the Improved 3D Diffusion Policy (iDP3), a novel 3D
visuomotor policy that eliminates these constraints by leveraging egocentric 3D
visual representations. We demonstrate that iDP3 enables a full-sized humanoid
robot to autonomously perform skills in diverse real-world scenarios, using
only data collected in the lab. Videos are available at:

### Boosting Camera Motion Control for Video Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Soon Yau Cheong, Duygu Ceylan, Armin Mustafa, Andrew Gilbert, Chun-Hao Paul Huang

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-14

**PDF Url**: [2410.10802v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10802v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the
quality of video generation. However, fine-grained control over camera pose
remains a challenge. While U-Net-based models have shown promising results for
camera control, transformer-based diffusion models (DiT)-the preferred
architecture for large-scale video generation - suffer from severe degradation
in camera motion accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the underlying causes
of this issue and propose solutions tailored to DiT architectures. Our study
reveals that camera control performance depends heavily on the choice of
conditioning methods rather than camera pose representations that is commonly
believed. To address the persistent motion degradation in DiT, we introduce
Camera Motion Guidance (CMG), based on classifier-free guidance, which boosts
camera control by over 400%. Additionally, we present a sparse camera control
pipeline, significantly simplifying the process of specifying camera poses for
long videos. Our method universally applies to both U-Net and DiT models,
offering improved camera control for video generation tasks.


## Quantitative Finance

**PDF Url**: [2410.09983v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09983v1)

**Abstract**: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial landscape, with
protocols like Uniswap offering innovative automated market-making mechanisms.
This article explores the development of a backtesting framework specifically
tailored for concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMM). The focus is on
leveraging the liquidity distribution approximated using a parametric model, to
estimate the rewards within liquidity pools.
  The article details the design, implementation, and insights derived from
this novel approach to backtesting within the context of Uniswap V3. The
developed backtester was successfully utilized to assess reward levels across
several pools using historical data from 2023 (pools Uniswap v3 for pairs of
altcoins, stablecoins and USDC/ETH with different fee levels). Moreover, the
error in modeling the level of rewards for the period under review for each
pool was less than 1\%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the backtester
in quantifying liquidity pool rewards and its potential in estimating LP's
revenues as part of the pool rewards, as focus of our next research.
  The backtester serves as a tool to simulate trading strategies and liquidity
provision scenarios, providing a quantitative assessment of potential returns
for liquidity providers (LP). By incorporating statistical tools to mirror CLMM
pool liquidity dynamics, this framework can be further leveraged for strategy
enhancement and risk evaluation for LPs operating within decentralized
exchanges.


### Scalable Signature-Based Distribution Regression via Reference Sets
**Authors**: Andrew Alden, Carmine Ventre, Blanka Horvath

**Published Date**: 2024-10-11

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-11

**PDF Url**: [2410.09196v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09196v1)

**Abstract**: Distribution Regression (DR) on stochastic processes describes the learning
task of regression on collections of time series. Path signatures, a technique
prevalent in stochastic analysis, have been used to solve the DR problem.
Recent works have demonstrated the ability of such solutions to leverage the
information encoded in paths via signature-based features. However, current
state of the art DR solutions are memory intensive and incur a high computation
cost. This leads to a trade-off between path length and the number of paths
considered. This computational bottleneck limits the application to small
sample sizes which consequently introduces estimation uncertainty. In this
paper, we present a methodology for addressing the above issues; resolving
estimation uncertainties whilst also proposing a pipeline that enables us to
use DR for a wide variety of learning tasks. Integral to our approach is our
novel distance approximator. This allows us to seamlessly apply our methodology
across different application domains, sampling rates, and stochastic process
dimensions. We show that our model performs well in applications related to
estimation theory, quantitative finance, and physical sciences. We demonstrate
that our model generalises well, not only to unseen data within a given
distribution, but also under unseen regimes (unseen classes of stochastic
models).
