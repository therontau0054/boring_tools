**Abstract**: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with
a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing
shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic.
We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth
rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio,
the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that
even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling
behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear
flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the
electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection
events in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker
Solar Probe.

**Abstract**: Generative models that satisfy hard constraints are crucial in many
scientific and engineering applications where physical laws or system
requirements must be strictly respected. However, many existing constrained
generative models, especially those developed for computer vision, rely heavily
on gradient information, often sparse or computationally expensive in fields
like partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for adapting pre-trained, unconstrained flow-matching models to
satisfy constraints exactly in a zero-shot manner without requiring expensive
gradient computations or fine-tuning. Our framework, ECI sampling, alternates
between extrapolation (E), correction (C), and interpolation (I) stages during
each iterative sampling step of flow matching sampling to ensure accurate
integration of constraint information while preserving the validity of the
generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various PDE
systems, showing that ECI-guided generation strictly adheres to physical
constraints and accurately captures complex distribution shifts induced by
these constraints. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework
consistently outperforms baseline approaches in various zero-shot constrained
generation tasks and also achieves competitive results in the regression tasks
without additional fine-tuning.

**Abstract**: In quantum many-body spin systems, the interplay between the entangling
effect of multi-qubit Pauli measurements and the disentangling effect of
single-qubit Pauli measurements may give rise to two competing effects. By
introducing a randomized measurement pattern with such bases, a phase
transition can be induced by altering the ratio between them. In this work, we
numerically investigate a measurement-based model associated with the $(2+1)$d
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fradkin-Shenker Hamiltonian model, encompassing the deconfining,
confining, and Higgs phases. We determine the phase diagram in our
measurement-only model by employing entanglement measures. For the bulk
topological order, we use the topological entanglement entropy. We also use the
mutual information between separated boundary regions to diagnose the boundary
phase transition associated with the Higgs or the bulk SPT phase. We observe
the structural similarity between our phase diagram and the one in the standard
quantum Hamiltonian formulation of the Fradkin-Shenker model with the open
rough boundary. First, a deconfining phase is detected by nonzero and constant
topological entanglement entropy. Second, we find a (boundary) phase transition
curve separating the Higgs=SPT phase from the rest. In certain limits, the
topological phase transitions reside at the critical point of the formation of
giant homological cycles in the bulk 3d spacetime lattice, as well as the bond
percolation threshold of the boundary 2d spacetime lattice when it is
effectively decoupled from the bulk. Additionally, there are analogous
mixed-phase properties at a certain region of the phase diagram, emerging from
how we terminate the measurement-based procedure. Our findings pave an
alternative pathway to study the physics of Higgs=SPT phases on quantum devices
in the near future.


### Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers

**Abstract**: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures
adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in
other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These
interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the
polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and
photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes
provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the
aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional
excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero
population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1
vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent
spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over
timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that
these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight
manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for
coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become
a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional
materials.

**PDF Url**: [2411.13713v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13713v2)

**Abstract**: For the first time, the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is
investigated, in which the chromatic dispersion and potential are specified by
two arbitrary functions. The equation in question is a natural generalization
of a wide class of related nonlinear partial differential equations that are
often used in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics,
superconductivity and plasma physics. To construct exact solutions, a
combination of the method of functional constraints and methods of generalized
separation of variables is used. Exact closed-form solutions of the general
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which are expressed in quadratures or
elementary functions, are found. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are
described, which lead the considered nonlinear partial differential equation to
a simpler ordinary differential equation or a system of such equations. The
exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to
assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for
integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics.


### Linear Standard Model extensions in the SMEFT at one loop and Tera-Z

**PDF Url**: [2412.01759v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01759v1)

**Abstract**: Linear Standard Model (SM) extensions, defined as new particles that can
couple linearly to SM fields, form a motivated and finite set of simplified
models for exploring phenomenology Beyond the SM (BSM). Heavy BSM particles may
be integrated out to obtain their low-energy effects in the SM Effective Field
Theory (SMEFT) parametrised by the Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional
operators. We compute and map the dimension-6 SMEFT operator structure of all
scalar and fermion linear SM extensions up to one-loop order, thus extending
the existing tree-level dictionary of results. Explicit analytic matching
expressions for the Wilson coefficients are provided as both Python and
Mathematica code in a GitHub repository accessible through links embedded in
our main table for each coefficient and within a Python package. We apply our
map to highlight the sensitivity to heavy new physics of a $Z$-pole run at a
future Tera-$Z$ factory; at one loop, with unit couplings, all linear SM
extensions can be indirectly probed by electroweak precision measurements up to
$\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.

**PDF Url**: [2412.01754v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01754v1)

**Abstract**: High-energy, large-scale particle colliders in nuclear and high-energy
physics generate data at extraordinary rates, reaching up to $1$ terabyte and
several petabytes per second, respectively. The development of real-time,
high-throughput data compression algorithms capable of reducing this data to
manageable sizes for permanent storage is of paramount importance. A unique
characteristic of the tracking detector data is the extreme sparsity of
particle trajectories in space, with an occupancy rate ranging from
approximately $10^{-6}$ to $10\%$. Furthermore, for downstream tasks, a
continuous representation of this data is often more useful than a voxel-based,
discrete representation due to the inherently continuous nature of the signals
involved. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach using
implicit neural representations for data learning and compression. We also
introduce an importance sampling technique to accelerate the network training
process. Our method is competitive with traditional compression algorithms,
such as MGARD, SZ, and ZFP, while offering significant speed-ups and
maintaining negligible accuracy loss through our importance sampling strategy.


### Counterfactual restrictions and Bell's theorem
**Authors**: Jonte R. Hance

**Published Date**: 2019-09-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-02

**PDF Url**: [1909.06608v6](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06608v6)

**Abstract**: We show that the ability to consider counterfactual situations is a necessary
assumption of Bell's theorem, and that, to allow Bell inequality violations
while maintaining all other assumptions, we just require certain measurement
choices be counterfactually restricted, rather than the full removal of
counterfactual definiteness. We illustrate how the counterfactual definiteness
assumption formally arises from the statistical independence assumption.
Counterfactual restriction therefore provides a way to interpret statistical
independence violation different to what is typically assumed (i.e. that
statistical independence violation means either retrocausality or
superdeterminism). We tie counterfactual restriction to contextuality, and show
the similarities to that approach.


### Ab initio study of Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in PbTe/Pb heterostructures
**Authors**: R. Reho, A. R. Botello-Méndez, Zeila Zanolli

**Published Date**: 2024-12-02

**Updated Date**: 2024-12-02

**PDF Url**: [2412.01749v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01749v1)

**Abstract**: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising
platforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find
applications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the
Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to
describe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb
heterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe
side. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous
charge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the
pairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for
unconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana
zero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier
in the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings
strengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices
and their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.


### The matter/life nexus in biological cells

**PDF Url**: [2412.01743v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01743v1)

**Abstract**: Physical motion has long been at the heart of what humans identify as life.
Early thinkers about what differentiates life from inanimate matter connected
agency to autonomous motion, a line of thinking that continued until Robert
Brown's experiments showed decisively that autonomous motion, and many other
physical behaviors and organizational principles, belong to inanimate matter.
An incredible trajectory of inquiry for the next 100 years showed that life is
characterized by the ability to reproduce, to inherit, to adapt. But throughout
this arc, a persistent search continued for that fundamental process, that gain
in function from matter to life. Subsequent decades showed that genetic
sequence is not enough. The leap occurs somewhere in cells' watery milieu -
physicochemical functions unique to life. In this Review, we explore how
advances in the last decade have embraced the deep coupling of physics and
cellular biochemistry to shed light on the matter/life nexus. Brownian flow
physics are more than implicated but rather help instantiate life. The reader
will observe in this review many references to works in cell biology - as many
or more than in biophysics or fluid mechanics. This is perhaps not as
intentional as it is unavoidable in the effort to see how matter becomes life
inside the watery compartment of the cell.

### GETAE: Graph information Enhanced deep neural NeTwork ensemble ArchitecturE for fake news detection

**PDF Url**: [2412.01825v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01825v1)

**Abstract**: In today's digital age, fake news has become a major problem that has serious
consequences, ranging from social unrest to political upheaval. To address this
issue, new methods for detecting and mitigating fake news are required. In this
work, we propose to incorporate contextual and network-aware features into the
detection process. This involves analyzing not only the content of a news
article but also the context in which it was shared and the network of users
who shared it, i.e., the information diffusion. Thus, we propose GETAE,
\underline{G}raph Information \underline{E}nhanced Deep Neural
Ne\underline{t}work Ensemble \underline{A}rchitectur\underline{E} for Fake News
Detection, a novel ensemble architecture that uses textual content together
with the social interactions to improve fake news detection. GETAE contains two
Branches: the Text Branch and the Propagation Branch. The Text Branch uses Word
and Transformer Embeddings and a Deep Neural Network based on feed-forward and
bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (\textsc{[Bi]RNN}) for learning novel
contextual features and creating a novel Text Content Embedding. The
Propagation Branch considers the information propagation within the graph
network and proposes a Deep Learning architecture that employs Node Embeddings
to create novel Propagation Embedding. GETAE Ensemble combines the two novel
embeddings, i.e., Text Content Embedding and Propagation Embedding, to create a
novel \textit{Propagation-Enhanced Content Embedding} which is afterward used
for classification. The experimental results obtained on two real-world
publicly available datasets, i.e., Twitter15 and Twitter16, prove that using
this approach improves fake news detection and outperforms state-of-the-art
models.

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based models have recently transformed conditional image
generation, achieving unprecedented fidelity in generating photorealistic and
semantically accurate images. However, consistently generating high-quality
images remains challenging, partly due to the lack of mechanisms for
conditioning outputs on perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to
integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based
generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. First, we experiment with
gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this
approach has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce
IQA-Adapter, a novel architecture that conditions generation on target quality
levels by learning the relationship between images and quality scores. When
conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter shifts the distribution of
generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain. This approach achieves up
to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a
subjective study, while preserving generative diversity and content.
Additionally, IQA-Adapter can be used inversely as a degradation model,
generating progressively more distorted images when conditioned on lower
quality scores. Our quality-aware methods also provide insights into the
adversarial robustness of IQA models, underscoring the potential of quality
conditioning in generative modeling and the importance of robust IQA methods.


### Brain Tumour Removing and Missing Modality Generation using 3D WDM

**PDF Url**: [2411.04630v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04630v2)

**Abstract**: This paper presents the second-placed solution for task 8 and the
participation solution for task 7 of BraTS 2024. The adoption of automated
brain analysis algorithms to support clinical practice is increasing. However,
many of these algorithms struggle with the presence of brain lesions or the
absence of certain MRI modalities. The alterations in the brain's morphology
leads to high variability and thus poor performance of predictive models that
were trained only on healthy brains. The lack of information that is usually
provided by some of the missing MRI modalities also reduces the reliability of
the prediction models trained with all modalities. In order to improve the
performance of these models, we propose the use of conditional 3D wavelet
diffusion models. The wavelet transform enabled full-resolution image training
and prediction on a GPU with 48 GB VRAM, without patching or downsampling,
preserving all information for prediction. The code for these tasks is
available at https://github.com/ShadowTwin41/BraTS_2023_2024_solutions.

**Abstract**: Modern datasets in neuroscience enable unprecedented inquiries into the
relationship between complex behaviors and the activity of many simultaneously
recorded neurons. While latent variable models can successfully extract
low-dimensional embeddings from such recordings, using them to generate
realistic spiking data, especially in a behavior-dependent manner, still poses
a challenge. Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS),
a diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS
employs an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project
discrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On
these inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models,
enabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and
population spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately
recovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we
demonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics
human cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with
an expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not
mediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated
samples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during
diverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach
direction or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables
inference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of
neural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating
experimentally testable hypotheses.

### Deep learning interpretability for rough volatility
**Authors**: Bo Yuan, Damiano Brigo, Antoine Jacquier, Nicola Pede

**PDF Url**: [2411.19317v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19317v1)

**Abstract**: Deep learning methods have become a widespread toolbox for pricing and
calibration of financial models. While they often provide new directions and
research results, their `black box' nature also results in a lack of
interpretability. We provide a detailed interpretability analysis of these
methods in the context of rough volatility - a new class of volatility models
for Equity and FX markets. Our work sheds light on the neural network learned
inverse map between the rough volatility model parameters, seen as mathematical
model inputs and network outputs, and the resulting implied volatility across
strikes and maturities, seen as mathematical model outputs and network inputs.
This contributes to building a solid framework for a safer use of neural
networks in this context and in quantitative finance more generally.
