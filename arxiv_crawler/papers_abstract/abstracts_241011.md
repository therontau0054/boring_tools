**Abstract**: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from
the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are
conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the
underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body
phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated
homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent
low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the
inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading
of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions,
and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit,
where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the
ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust
to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our
experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from
equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.

**Abstract**: Yb:KGW lasers have been gaining increasing importance in ultrafast and
strong-field physics, but their compression to the single- and sub- cycle
regime remains a challenge. Here, we utilized a dual hollow-core fiber module
for the spectral broadening of Yb:KGW pulses to more than 3.5 optical octaves,
from the short-wave infrared (~1900 nm) to vacuum ultraviolet (~170 nm). A
light-field-synthesizer compressed a large portion of this bandwidth (380-1000
nm) to single-cycle pulses for the first time, based on Yb:KGW technology. Our
work opens the door to attaining new regimes of control and temporal
compression of light pulses and their advanced applications in ultrafast
spectroscopy.

**Abstract**: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension
and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of
the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie
algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector
fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry.
Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal
supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any
amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra
exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher
Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our
techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the
stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal
operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of
functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the
distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as
K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace
geometry.

**PDF Url**: [2410.08166v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08166v1)

**Abstract**: A brief overview of the current state of the problem of electromagnetic field
singularities arising from the refraction and scattering of light by material
objects is given. The discussion begins with caustics arising from ray tracing
in geometric optics and consistently moves toward increasing the accuracy of
consideration and decreasing the scale, ending with a description of
singularities in light scattering by subwavelength particles. Common and
distinctive features of various types of singularities, the role of the
symmetry of the problem and the law of conservation of energy are revealed.
Physical foundations and methods for overcoming the diffraction limit are
discussed. The theoretical description is illustrated by experimental examples.
Various practical applications of the effects under consideration are
indicated.

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of
neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However,
achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains
challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent
effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D
spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects,
but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this
paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS),
which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional
directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our
approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves
real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects
and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms
3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction
of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS. The project page is:

### No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments
**Authors**: Carlos Barceló, Raúl Carballo-Rubio, Luis J. Garay, Gerardo García-Moreno

**PDF Url**: [2410.08128v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08128v1)

**Abstract**: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric
of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated
under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the
horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This
limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as
binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to
horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the
asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes
surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the
metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the
static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a
one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given
external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central
object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show
that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one
approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures
are bounded.

**Abstract**: This study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct
multiple flow fields in a transient natural convection system solely based on
instantaneous temperature data at an arbitrary moment. Transient convection
problems present reconstruction challenges due to the temporal variability of
fields across different flow phases. In general, large reconstruction errors
are observed during the incipient phase, while the quasi-steady phase exhibits
relatively smaller errors, reduced by a factor of 2 to 4. We hypothesize that
reconstruction errors vary across different flow phases due to the changing
solution space of a PINN, inferred from the temporal gradients of the fields.
Furthermore, we find that reconstruction errors tend to accumulate in regions
where the spatial gradients are smaller than the order of $10^{-6}$, likely due
to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. In convection phenomena, field variations
often manifest across multiple scales in space. However, PINN-based
reconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale
variations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem. To
mitigate the errors associated with vanishing gradients, we introduce a
multi-scale approach that determines scaling constants for the PINN inputs and
reformulates inputs across multiple scales. This approach improves the maximum
and mean errors by 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Our research provides insights
into the behavior of PINNs when applied to transient convection problems with
large solution space and field variations across multiple scales.


### Chaotic motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes

**Abstract**: We investigate the motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole
immersed in swirling universes. Using the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov
exponent indicator, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction, we present
the effects of the swirling parameter and the spin parameter on the dynamical
behaviors of the motion of particles, and confirm the presence of chaos in the
motion of particles in this background spacetime. We find that the swirling
parameter can change the range of the spin parameter where the chaos occurs,
and vice versa. Moreover, we observe clearly that, regardless of the spin
parameter, there exist some self-similar fractal fine structures in the basins
boundaries of attractors for the spacetime of a black hole immersed in swirling
universes. The combination the swirling parameter and the spin parameter
provides richer physics in the motion of particles.


### On cat-human interaction from the viewpoint of physics: an equation of motion
**Authors**: Anxo Biasi

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-10

**PDF Url**: [2409.05400v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05400v2)

**Abstract**: This paper provides an enjoyable example through which several concepts of
classical mechanics can be understood. We introduce an equation that models the
motion of a cat in the presence of a person. The cat is considered as a point
particle moving in a potential induced by the person. We demonstrate that this
approach to the problem reproduces characteristic behaviors of these curious
animals. For instance, the fact that cats do not typically come when they are
called, or that they remain longer on the lap of their favorite person; even
"zoomies" are reproduced (cats randomly run back and forth across the house).
We use this model problem to explore topics of current research such as
stochastic equations and periodically driven systems. The pedagogical value of
this work and its potential use in teaching are discussed.

**PDF Url**: [2410.08089v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08089v1)

**Abstract**: We have computed the even-N moments N =< 20 of the gluon-gluon splitting
function P_{gg} at the fourth order of perturbative QCD via the renormalization
of off-shell operator matrix elements. Our results, derived analytically for a
general compact simple gauge group, agree with all results obtained for this
function so far, in particular with the lowest five moments obtained via
structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering. Using our new moments and all
available endpoint constraints, we construct improved approximations for the
four-loop P_{gg}(x) that should be sufficient for a wide range of
collider-physics applications. The N^3LO contributions to the scale derivative
of the gluon distribution, resulting from these and the corresponding
quark-to-gluon splitting functions, amount to 1% or less at x >~ 10^{-4} at a
standard reference scale with alpha_s = 0.2.


## Diffusion
### Emerging Pixel Grounding in Large Multimodal Models Without Grounding Supervision
**Authors**: Shengcao Cao, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang

**PDF Url**: [2410.08209v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08209v1)

**Abstract**: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which
requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary
to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding
supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs
trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging
grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages
attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation.
Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM
utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP
visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being
constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision
data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive
performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering
benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively.
Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation
generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively
supervised model GLaMM. Project page: https://groundLMM.github.io.

**Abstract**: Discrete diffusion models have achieved success in tasks like image
generation and masked language modeling but face limitations in controlled
content editing. We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable
Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion
models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By
recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion
process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete
data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains,
evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results
show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing
capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation
in discrete spaces. For project webpage, see

### Sparse Repellency for Shielded Generation in Text-to-image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Michael Kirchhof, James Thornton, Pierre Ablin, Louis Béthune, Eugene Ndiaye, Marco Cuturi

**Published Date**: 2024-10-08

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-10

**PDF Url**: [2410.06025v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06025v2)

**Abstract**: The increased adoption of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
triggered concerns on their reliability. Such models are now closely
scrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness,
or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when
deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a
tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we
propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion
models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this
by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation
trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too
closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the
sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and
even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named
SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set
that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each
timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We
show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity
while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better
than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how
SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected
images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.


### DifFRelight: Diffusion-Based Facial Performance Relighting
**Authors**: Mingming He, Pascal Clausen, Ahmet Levent Taşel, Li Ma, Oliver Pilarski, Wenqi Xian, Laszlo Rikker, Xueming Yu, Ryan Burgert, Ning Yu, Paul Debevec

**PDF Url**: [2410.08188v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08188v1)

**Abstract**: We present a novel framework for free-viewpoint facial performance relighting
using diffusion-based image-to-image translation. Leveraging a subject-specific
dataset containing diverse facial expressions captured under various lighting
conditions, including flat-lit and one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) scenarios, we
train a diffusion model for precise lighting control, enabling high-fidelity
relit facial images from flat-lit inputs. Our framework includes
spatially-aligned conditioning of flat-lit captures and random noise, along
with integrated lighting information for global control, utilizing prior
knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is then
applied to dynamic facial performances captured in a consistent flat-lit
environment and reconstructed for novel-view synthesis using a scalable dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting method to maintain quality and consistency in the relit
results. In addition, we introduce unified lighting control by integrating a
novel area lighting representation with directional lighting, allowing for
joint adjustments in light size and direction. We also enable high dynamic
range imaging (HDRI) composition using multiple directional lights to produce
dynamic sequences under complex lighting conditions. Our evaluations
demonstrate the models efficiency in achieving precise lighting control and
generalizing across various facial expressions while preserving detailed
features such as skintexture andhair. The model accurately reproduces complex
lighting effects like eye reflections, subsurface scattering, self-shadowing,
and translucency, advancing photorealism within our framework.


### DART: Denoising Autoregressive Transformer for Scalable Text-to-Image Generation

**PDF Url**: [2410.08159v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08159v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have become the dominant approach for visual generation.
They are trained by denoising a Markovian process that gradually adds noise to
the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the models ability to
fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during
training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based
model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian
framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally
using an AR model with the same architecture as standard language models. DART
does not rely on image quantization, enabling more effective image modeling
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both
text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive
performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a
scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this
unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image
synthesis.

**PDF Url**: [2407.03431v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03431v2)

**Abstract**: We expose a theoretical hedging optimization framework with variational
preferences under convex risk measures. We explore a general dual
representation for the composition between risk measures and utilities. We
study the properties of the optimization problem as a convex and monotone map
per se. We also derive results for optimality and indifference pricing
conditions. We also explore particular examples inside our setup.


### Coherent risk measures and uniform integrability
**Authors**: Muqiao Huang, Ruodu Wang

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-07

**PDF Url**: [2404.03783v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03783v2)

**Abstract**: We establish a profound connection between coherent risk measures, a
prominent object in quantitative finance, and uniform integrability, a
fundamental concept in probability theory. Instead of working with absolute
values of random variables, which is convenient in studying integrability, we
work directly with random loses and gains, which have clear financial
interpretation. We introduce a technical tool called the folding score of
distortion risk measures. The analysis of the folding score allows us to
convert some conditions on absolute values to those on gains and losses. As our
main results, we obtain three sets of equivalent conditions for uniform
integrability. In particular, a set is uniformly integrable if and only if one
can find a coherent distortion risk measure that is bounded on the set, but not
finite on $L^1$.
