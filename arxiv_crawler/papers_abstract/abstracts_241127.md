**Abstract**: In drug discovery, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein-ligand
binding provides a powerful tool for predicting binding affinities, estimating
transport properties, and exploring pocket sites. There has been a long history
of improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods
and, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges
remain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address
this issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate
numerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding
dynamics. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel
physics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we
propose (1) the BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector
frames and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an
augmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under
Newtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and
three multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency
and effectiveness of NeuralMD, achieving over 1K$\times$ speedup compared to
standard numerical MD simulations. NeuralMD also outperforms all other ML
approaches, achieving up to 15$\times$ reduction in reconstruction error and
70% increase in validity. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate that the
oscillations in the predicted trajectories align more closely with ground-truth
dynamics than those of other machine-learning methods. We believe NeuralMD
paves the foundation for a new research paradigm in simulating protein-ligand
dynamics.

**Abstract**: This work explores the use of Role Playing Games (RPG) as an active
methodology in teaching Modern Physics, focusing on a game called Newton's
Revenge. The game was developed with the aim of engaging students in
collaborative and investigative learning processes, using gamification elements
to increase motivation and involvement. Based on the constructivist theories of
Piaget and Vygotsky, the RPG stimu-\newline lates cognitive and social
development by placing students in the roles of historical science figures.
Through contextualized physical challenges, such as understanding the
Photoelectric Effect, participants actively construct knowledge. This study
presents preliminary learning data obtained through pre- and post-tests, as
well as evaluates students' perceptions of using educational games in science
education. The results indicate that the use of RPG can be an effective tool
for teaching Modern Physics, promoting greater engagement and understanding of
scientific concepts.

**Abstract**: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient
approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local
nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework
provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and
topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its
topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative
environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework
enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological
protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the
spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras,
and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires
developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than
those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology.
In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a
ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for
understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of
topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the
framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including
crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can
be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework,
including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this
introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator
pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that
form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.

**Abstract**: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are
instrumental for studying sub-atomic dynamics, and are often produced from a
free electron laser (FEL) by electron microbunches in an undulator. An
optical-FEL (OFEL) utilizes a counter-propagating laser pulse instead of an
undulator, and has been proposed as a more compact and tunable source than a
FEL. Yet, an OFEL is difficult to realize because of the high electron density
required and subsequent high emittance. We demonstrate that broadband coherent
XUV light, which in the temporal domain corresponds to a train of attosecond
pulses with 8-as duration at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching
of relativistic electrons and positrons in an optical laser pulse. The symmetry
between electrons and positrons in the bunch stabilizes the system and enables
the rapid formation of dense microbunches over a ten-micrometer distance
instead of the tens of meters typically required in an undulator. The high
microbunch density and the stable spectral phase up to emitted photon energies
of about 350 eV, allow for the creation of orders of magnitude more compact
sources of XUV light that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and
industry.

**Abstract**: We introduce the usage of equivariant neural networks in the search for
violations of the charge-parity ($\textit{CP}$) symmetry in particle
interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We design neural networks that
take as inputs kinematic information of recorded events and that transform
equivariantly under the a symmetry group related to the $\textit{CP}$
transformation. We show that this algorithm allows to define observables
reflecting the properties of the $\textit{CP}$ symmetry, showcasing its
performance in several reference processes in top quark and electroweak
physics. Imposing equivariance as an inductive bias in the algorithm improves
the numerical convergence properties with respect to other methods that do not
rely on equivariance and allows to construct optimal observables that
significantly improve the state-of-the-art methodology in the searches
considered.

**Abstract**: Hydrogen combustion systems operated under fuel-lean conditions offer great
potential for low emissions. However, these operating conditions are also
susceptible to intrinsic thermodiffusive combustion instabilities. Even though
technical combustors are enclosed by walls that significantly influence the
combustion process, intrinsic flame instabilities have mostly been investigated
in canonical freely-propagating flame configurations unconfined by walls. This
study aims to close this gap by investigating the flame-wall interaction of
thermodiffusive unstable hydrogen/air flame through detailed numerical
simulations in a two-dimensional head-on quenching configuration. It presents
an in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of the quenching process,
revealing the major impact factors of the instabilities on the quenching
characteristics. The thermodiffusive instabilities result in lower quenching
distances and increased wall heat fluxes compared to one-dimensional head-on
quenching flames under similar operation conditions. The change in quenching
characteristics seems not to be driven by kinematic effects. Instead, the
increased wall heat fluxes are caused by the enhanced flame reactivity of the
unstable flame approaching the wall, which results from mixture variations
associated with the instabilities. Overall, the study highlights the importance
of studying flame-wall interaction in more complex domains than simple
one-dimensional configurations, where such instabilities are inherently
suppressed. Further, it emphasizes the need to incorporate local mixture
variations induced by intrinsic combustion instabilities in combustion models
for flame-wall interactions. In part II of this study, the scope is expanded to
gas turbine and internal combustion engine relevant conditions through a
parametric study, varying the equivalence ratio, pressure, and unburnt
temperature.

**Abstract**: Objective: Proton spot-scanning arc therapy (ARC) is an emerging modality
that can improve the high-dose conformity to targets compared with standard
intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). However, the efficient treatment
delivery of ARC is challenging due to the required frequent energy changes
during the continuous gantry rotation. This work proposes a novel method that
delivers a multiple IMPT (multi-IMPT) plan that is equivalent to ARC in terms
of biologically effective dose (BED).
  Approach: The proposed multi-IMPT method utilizes a different subset of
limited number of beam angles in each fraction for dose delivery. Due to the
different dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR) in each fraction, we optimize
biologically effective dose (BED) for OAR and the physical dose delivered for
target in each fraction. The BED-based multi-IMPT inverse optimization problem
is solved via the iterative convex relaxation method and the alternating
direction method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-IMPT
method is evaluated in terms of dose objectives in comparison with ARC.
  Main results: Multi-IMPT provided similar plan quality with ARC. For example,
multi-IMPT provided better OAR sparing and slightly better target dose coverage
for the prostate case; similar dose distribution for the lung case; slightly
worse dose coverage for the brain case; better dose coverage but slightly
higher BED in OAR for the head-and-neck case.
  Significance: We have proposed a multi-IMPT approach to deliver
ARC-equivalent plan quality.
  Keywords: biologically effective dose (BED), proton arc therapy

**Abstract**: In the past, quasi coherent modes were reported for nearly all tokamaks. The
general definition describes modes as quasi coherent when the magnitude squared
coherence is in the range of \SIrange{0.3}{0.6}{}. Quasi coherent modes are
observed in the plasma core as well as in the plasma edge and can have quite
different physical origins. The one in the core are observed in plasmas with
low collisionality, where the electron temperature exceeds the ion temperature
in the plasma core. This is the case for electron cyclotron heating in general.
The origin of these modes are electrons trapped within a magnetic mirror, as
reported in the past from various fusion devices. The so-called
trapped-electron modes (TEMs) belong to drift wave instabilities and can be
destabilized by electron-temperature gradients in the plasma core. From the
diagnostic point of view, quasi coherent modes appear as fluctuations in
electron density and temperature. Therefore, the microwave reflectometer is
very well suited to monitor these modes. This paper describes experiments,
conducted at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X), which aim at detecting
quasi coherent modes at low wave numbers. A Poloidal Correlation Reflectometer
(PCR) installed at W7-X, is able to measure low wave numbers ($k_\perp\le 3.5$
cm$^{-1}$). For different magnetic configurations and plasma parameters, broad
quasi-coherent structures are observed in the coherence spectra. From the
analysis of the rotation and the poloidal structure, these quasi coherent (QC)
modes show the properties of electron-temperature-gradient driven TEMs. A
linear relation between the mode velocity and the rotation frequency is found.
The relation is uniform and confirms the nature of QC-mode observation as TEM
in tokamaks, too.

**Abstract**: Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a
high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field
Quantum Electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of
laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of
the spatial and temporal scales and because quantum and classical descriptions
need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and
quantum for nearly-instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair
creation). A typical configuration for experiments is a scattering of an
electron and a laser beam which can be mapped to an equivalent problem with
constant magnetic field. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in
a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution
functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate
closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply
the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the
Fokker-Planck equation describing this process, and compare against theory and
results from Particle-In-Cell simulations and classical Partial Differential
Equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first
step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion
processes are important, in particular in strong electromagnetic fields.


### Scalar and tensor meson dominance and gravitational form factors of the pion

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-26

**PDF Url**: [2411.10354v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10354v2)

**Abstract**: We analyze the recent MIT lattice data for the gravitational form factors
(GFFs) of the pion which extend up to $Q^2= 2~{\rm GeV}^2$ for
$m_\pi=170$~MeV~\cite{Hackett:2023nkr}. We show that simple monopole fits
comply with the old idea of meson dominance. We use Chiral Perturbation theory
($\chi$PT) to next-to-leading order (NLO) to transform the MIT data to the
physical world with $m_\pi=140~$MeV and find that the spin-0 GFF is effectively
saturated with the $f_0(600)$ and the spin-2 with the $f_2(1270)$, with
monopole masses $m_\sigma= 630(60)$~MeV and $m_{f_2}= 1270(40)$~MeV. We
determine in passing the chiral low energy constants (LECs) from the MIT
lattice data alone \[ 10^3 \cdot L_{11} (m_\rho^2)=1.06(15) \, , \qquad 10^3
\cdot L_{12} (m_\rho^2)= -2.2(1) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{13} (m_\rho^2) =
-0.7(1.1). \] which agree in sign and order of magnitude % to be compared with
the original estimates by Donoghue and Leutwyler. The corresponding D-term
(druck) has the value $ D(0) = -0.95(3) $. We also analyze the sum rules based
on perturbative QCD (pQCD) that imply that the corresponding spectral functions
are not positive definite. We show that these sum rules are strongly violated
in a variety of $\pi\pi-K \bar K$ coupled channel Omn\`es-Muskhelishvili
calculations. This is not mended by the inclusion of the pQCD tail, suggesting
the need for an extra negative spectral strength. Using a simple model
implementing all sum rules, we find the expected onset of pQCD at very high
momenta.

**Abstract**: Current diffusion models for human image animation struggle to ensure
identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents StableAnimator, the first
end-to-end ID-preserving video diffusion framework, which synthesizes
high-quality videos without any post-processing, conditioned on a reference
image and a sequence of poses. Building upon a video diffusion model,
StableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and
inference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator
begins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors,
respectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image
embeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder. Then, StableAnimator
introduces a novel distribution-aware ID Adapter that prevents interference
caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via alignment. During inference,
we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimization to
further enhance the face quality. We demonstrate that solving the HJB equation
can be integrated into the diffusion denoising process, and the resulting
solution constrains the denoising path and thus benefits ID preservation.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator
both qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Abstract**: Generative quantum machine learning has gained significant attention for its
ability to produce quantum states with desired distributions. Among various
quantum generative models, quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(QuDDPMs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 100602 (2024)] provide a promising approach
with stepwise learning that resolves the training issues. However, the
requirement of high-fidelity scrambling unitaries in QuDDPM poses a challenge
in near-term implementation. We propose the \textit{mixed-state quantum
denoising diffusion probabilistic model} (MSQuDDPM) to eliminate the need for
scrambling unitaries. Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise
channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise
channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits
with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce
several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of
noise interpolation, the use of single-qubit random ancilla, and
superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate
MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful
performance.


### On Statistical Rates of Conditional Diffusion Transformers: Approximation, Estimation and Minimax Optimality
**Authors**: Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weimin Wu, Yi-Chen Lee, Yu-Chao Huang, Minshuo Chen, Han Liu

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-26

**PDF Url**: [2411.17522v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17522v1)

**Abstract**: We investigate the approximation and estimation rates of conditional
diffusion transformers (DiTs) with classifier-free guidance. We present a
comprehensive analysis for ``in-context'' conditional DiTs under four common
data assumptions. We show that both conditional DiTs and their latent variants
lead to the minimax optimality of unconditional DiTs under identified settings.
Specifically, we discretize the input domains into infinitesimal grids and then
perform a term-by-term Taylor expansion on the conditional diffusion score
function under H\"older smooth data assumption. This enables fine-grained use
of transformers' universal approximation through a more detailed piecewise
constant approximation and hence obtains tighter bounds. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to the latent setting under the linear latent subspace
assumption. We not only show that latent conditional DiTs achieve lower bounds
than conditional DiTs both in approximation and estimation, but also show the
minimax optimality of latent unconditional DiTs. Our findings establish
statistical limits for conditional and unconditional DiTs, and offer practical
guidance toward developing more efficient and accurate DiT models.


### WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent Video Diffusion Model

**Abstract**: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional
latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models
(LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration
of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a
limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference
method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when
processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational
bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently
encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into
multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly,
we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages
multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into
latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,
which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.
Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior
performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and
4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction
quality. Our code and models are available at
https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE.


### Efficient Long Video Tokenization via Coordinate-based Patch Reconstruction

**Abstract**: Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision
models that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a
tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to
leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However,
training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost
as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we
introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from
coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos,
inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok
encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs
patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows
for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring
excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can
drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For
instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\times$128 resolution
into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar
reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization
enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate
128 frames at once.
