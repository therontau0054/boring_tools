**Abstract**: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a
crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will
soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially
far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics.
However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early
Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of
Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries
generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment,
obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate
that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely
eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our
findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the
laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.

**Abstract**: When two AI models are trained on the same scientific task, do they learn the
same theory or two different theories? Throughout history of science, we have
witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or
falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking,
but the space of survived theories become more constrained with more
experimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI
scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI
scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes
they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To
mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their
agreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI
Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training
results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI
scientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a
Hamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more
complex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the
training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of
relevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks
aid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.


### Excitation of the Glashow resonance without neutrino beams

**Abstract**: The $s$-channel process $\bar\nu_ee^-\rightarrow W^-$(on-shell) is now
referred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale
neutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a
decade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino
events such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous
confirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its
experimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the
Standard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow
resonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This
article suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely,
that the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator
energies, occurring as $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^-\rho(770)^+$. Although the
resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent,
quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\rho^+$ from the
initial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\bar\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP
conjugate channel, $\nu_e e^+\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form
$e^+e^-\rightarrow W^+\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons are also
possible. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem
to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory
conditions.


### Quantum theory does not need complex numbers
**Authors**: Timothee Hoffreumon, Mischa P. Woods

**Abstract**: The longstanding debate over whether quantum theory fundamentally requires
complex numbers--or if their use is merely a convenient choice--has persisted
for decades. Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in
[M.-O. Renou et al, Nature 600, 625-629, 2021], a decisive argument was
presented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers. In this work, we
demonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers
is indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation
locality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to
the states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We
observe that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was
derived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By
starting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive
a combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties
analogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that
the conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and
representation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the
state space. We thus conclude that complex numbers are a mere convenience in
quantum theory.


### Interpreting gravitational fields of Topologically Massive Gravity using geodesic deviation
**Authors**: Matus Papajcik, Jiri Podolsky

**Published Date**: 2025-04-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.02772v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02772v1)

**Abstract**: We study relative motion of nearby test particles in Topologically Massive
Gravity (TMG) in three spacetime dimensions, using the equation of geodesic
deviation. We show that, in a suitable reference frame, the influence of any
gravitational field can be decomposed into transverse, longitudinal, and
Newtonian components, which are directly related to the Cotton scalars of the
Newman-Penrose-type. In particular, we prove that Cotton type N spacetimes
exhibit a purely transverse gravitational effect on test particles, and can
thus be reasonably interpreted as specific gravitational waves with a single
polarization mode in TMG. The influence of the cosmological constant manifests
itself as an isotropic effect. We also discuss the physical interpretation of
spacetimes of specific algebraic types, as well as the influence of various
matter fields, namely pure radiation, perfect fluid, and electromagnetic field.
As an example, we provide an explicit analysis of TN-waves and pp-waves in
three-dimensional TMG.


### Quantum state preparation for multivariate functions

**PDF Url**: [2405.21058v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21058v2)

**Abstract**: A fundamental step of any quantum algorithm is the preparation of qubit
registers in a suitable initial state. Often qubit registers represent a
discretization of continuous variables and the initial state is defined by a
multivariate function. We develop protocols for preparing quantum states whose
amplitudes encode multivariate functions by linearly combining block-encodings
of Fourier and Chebyshev basis functions. Without relying on arithmetic
circuits, quantum Fourier transforms, or multivariate quantum signal
processing, our algorithms are simpler and more effective than previous
proposals. We analyze requirements both asymptotically and pragmatically in
terms of near/medium-term resources. Numerically, we prepare bivariate
Student's t-distributions, 2D Ricker wavelets and electron wavefunctions in a
3D Coulomb potential, which are initial states with potential applications in
finance, physics and chemistry simulations. Finally, we prepare bivariate
Gaussian distributions on the Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum processor
using 24 qubits and up to 237 two-qubit gates.

**Abstract**: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a fascinating and
complex phenomenon in condensed matter physics, as these two states are
typically mutually exclusive due to their competing spin configurations.
However, the interplay between these two orders through the proximity effect
has been a subject of intense research as it opens up possibilities for novel
technological applications. Here, we report the coexistence of
superconductivity and ferromagnetism in superconducting
{\delta}-TaN/ferromagnetic CoFeB heterostructures grown by facing-target
sputtering. Superconducting states are comprehensively investigated, with
evidence of strong correlation between the superconducting and ferromagnetic
order parameters. In particular, we observed an anomalous Hall signal without
the presence of the magnetic field in the mixed state of the superconducting
transition near the critical temperature. Systematic characterizations of the
Hall resistance under varying temperatures and magnetic fields attribute this
behavior to the vortex Hall effect (VHE), whereby superconducting vortices in
the mixed state undergo transverse motions near the critical temperature.
Unlike previously reported VHEs in conventional type-II superconductors, the
anomalous VHE in TaN is induced by the stray field in the underlying CoFeB
layers. The concurrency of strong spin-orbit coupling, the superconductivity in
the TaN layer, and the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic ordering in the
CoFeB layer offers new insights into proximity-induced vortex dynamics and the
design of novel superconducting spintronic devices.

**Abstract**: Given the latest observational constraints coming from the joint analyses of
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the Planck Satellite and other missions, we
point out the possibility of reconciling fundamental particle-physics models of
inflation with data by considering non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions for
primordial density perturbations.


### Is Lorentz invariance violation found?
**Authors**: Giorgio Galanti, Marco Roncadelli

**Published Date**: 2025-04-02

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.01830v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01830v2)

**Abstract**: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable
low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect
LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy
photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO
collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet
collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration
has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their
previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$,
which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face
value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection
cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the
observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a
scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future
observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum
gravity phenomenology.


### Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order
**Authors**: Shang-Qiang Ning, Yang Qi, Chenjie Wang, Zheng-Cheng Gu

**Published Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.02736v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02736v1)

**Abstract**: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent
incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in
the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a
systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order.
Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of
the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In
this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional
fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins
of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related
to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times
Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal
symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such
fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show
that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison,
conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also
discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.


## Diffusion
### Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation Transplant
**Authors**: Jinqi Luo, Tianjiao Ding, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Hancheng Min, Chris Callison-Burch, René Vidal

**Published Date**: 2025-04-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.02828v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02828v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing
methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an
edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure
faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual
consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each
source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to
search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this
challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play
framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image
editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text
embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the
representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately
estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based
on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept
transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To
sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation
dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of
visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple
diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan
achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency
preservation.


### Quantum Generative Models for Image Generation: Insights from MNIST and MedMNIST
**Authors**: Chi-Sheng Chen, Wei An Hou, Hsiang-Wei Hu, Zhen-Sheng Cai

**Published Date**: 2025-03-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.00034v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00034v2)

**Abstract**: Quantum generative models offer a promising new direction in machine learning
by leveraging quantum circuits to enhance data generation capabilities. In this
study, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical image generation framework that
integrates variational quantum circuits into a diffusion-based model. To
improve training dynamics and generation quality, we introduce two novel noise
strategies: intrinsic quantum-generated noise and a tailored noise scheduling
mechanism. Our method is built upon a lightweight U-Net architecture, with the
quantum layer embedded in the bottleneck module to isolate its effect. We
evaluate our model on MNIST and MedMNIST datasets to examine its feasibility
and performance. Notably, our results reveal that under limited data conditions
(fewer than 100 training images), the quantum-enhanced model generates images
with higher perceptual quality and distributional similarity than its classical
counterpart using the same architecture. While the quantum model shows
advantages on grayscale data such as MNIST, its performance is more nuanced on
complex, color-rich datasets like PathMNIST. These findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of quantum generative models and lay the
groundwork for future developments in low-resource and biomedical image
generation.


### Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets

**Abstract**: Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building
generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot
foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality
expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide
range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data
provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and
agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation
learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation
required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World
Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data
for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process
and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where
independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply
controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a
forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated
and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining
on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action
predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation
learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data
through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further
improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM
offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for
scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often
disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling. Videos and code

### Scene Splatter: Momentum 3D Scene Generation from Single Image with Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Shengjun Zhang, Jinzhao Li, Xin Fei, Hao Liu, Yueqi Duan

**Published Date**: 2025-04-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.02764v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02764v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose Scene Splatter, a momentum-based paradigm for video
diffusion to generate generic scenes from single image. Existing methods, which
employ video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited
video length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions
during further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy
samples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and
maintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception
field that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum
restricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions.
Therefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a
pixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better
recovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion
models to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further
finetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render
new frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can
iteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior
performance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.


### RBR4DNN: Requirements-based Testing of Neural Networks
**Authors**: Nusrat Jahan Mozumder, Felipe Toledo, Swaroopa Dola, Matthew B. Dwyer

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-03

**PDF Url**: [2504.02737v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02737v1)

**Abstract**: Deep neural network (DNN) testing is crucial for the reliability and safety
of critical systems, where failures can have severe consequences. Although
various techniques have been developed to create robustness test suites,
requirements-based testing for DNNs remains largely unexplored -- yet such
tests are recognized as an essential component of software validation of
critical systems. In this work, we propose a requirements-based test suite
generation method that uses structured natural language requirements formulated
in a semantic feature space to create test suites by prompting text-conditional
latent diffusion models with the requirement precondition and then using the
associated postcondition to define a test oracle to judge outputs of the DNN
under test. We investigate the approach using fine-tuned variants of
pre-trained generative models. Our experiments on the MNIST, CelebA-HQ,
ImageNet, and autonomous car driving datasets demonstrate that the generated
test suites are realistic, diverse, consistent with preconditions, and capable
of revealing faults.
