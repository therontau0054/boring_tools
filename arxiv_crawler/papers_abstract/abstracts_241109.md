**Abstract**: The classification of topological phases of matter is a fundamental challenge
in quantum many-body physics, with applications to quantum technology.
Recently, this classification has been extended to the setting of Adaptive
Finite-Depth Local Unitary (AFDLU) circuits which allow global classical
communication. In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all
topological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete
classification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable
anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results
on solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with
irrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic
anyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an
AFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological
phase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition,
we introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU
implementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and
symmetry twist defects in solvable anyon theories. We apply our procedure to
the quantum double of the group $S_3$ and to several examples that are beyond
solvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$
Tambara-Yamagami string-net, and doubled $SU(2)_4$ anyons.

**Abstract**: The ability to predict future outcomes given control actions is fundamental
for physical reasoning. However, such predictive models, often called world
models, have proven challenging to learn and are typically developed for
task-specific solutions with online policy learning. We argue that the true
potential of world models lies in their ability to reason and plan across
diverse problems using only passive data. Concretely, we require world models
to have the following three properties: 1) be trainable on offline,
pre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3)
facilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To realize this, we present DINO World
Model (DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing
the visual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with
DINOv2, enabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting
future patch features. This design allows DINO-WM to achieve observational
goals through action sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic behavior
planning by treating desired goal patch features as prediction targets. We
evaluate DINO-WM across various domains, including maze navigation, tabletop
pushing, and particle manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that DINO-WM
can generate zero-shot behavioral solutions at test time without relying on
expert demonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models. Notably,
DINO-WM exhibits strong generalization capabilities compared to prior
state-of-the-art work, adapting to diverse task families such as arbitrarily
configured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and
multi-particle scenarios.


### Kinetic Theory of Stellar Systems: A Tutorial
**Authors**: Chris Hamilton, Jean-Baptiste Fouvry

**Published Date**: 2024-02-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-07

**PDF Url**: [2402.13322v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13322v2)

**Abstract**: Stellar systems - star clusters, galaxies, dark matter haloes, and so on -
are ubiquitous characters in the evolutionary tale of our Universe. This
tutorial article is an introduction to the collective dynamical evolution of
the very large numbers of stars and/or other self-gravitating objects that
comprise such systems, i.e. their kinetic theory.
  We begin by introducing the basic phenomenology of stellar systems, and
explaining why and when we must develop a kinetic theory that transcends the
traditional two-body relaxation picture of Chandrasekhar. We study the orbits
that comprise stellar systems, how those orbits are modified by perturbations,
how a system responds self-consistently to fluctuations in its gravitational
potential, and how one can predict the long term fate of a stellar system in
various dynamical regimes. Though our treatment is necessarily mathematical, we
develop the formalism only to the extent that it facilitates real calculations.
We give many examples throughout the text of the equations being applied to
topics of major astrophysical importance.
  Furthermore, in the 1960s and 1970s the kinetic theory of stellar systems was
a fledgling subject which developed in tandem with the kinetic theory of
plasmas. However, the two fields have long since diverged. Yet once one has
become fluent in both Plasmaish and Galacticese, and has a dictionary relating
the two, one can pull ideas directly from one field to solve a problem in the
other. Therefore, another aim of this tutorial article is to provide our plasma
colleagues with a jargon-light understanding of the key properties of stellar
systems, to point out the many direct analogies between stellar- and
plasma-kinetic calculations, and ultimately to convince them that stellar
dynamics and plasma kinetics are, in a deep and beautiful and useful sense, the
same thing.

**Abstract**: Quantum technologies provide many applications for information processing
tasks that are impossible to realize within classical physics. These
capabilities include such fundamental resources as generating secure, i.e.
private and unpredictable random values. Yet, the problem of quantifying the
amount of generated randomness is still not fully solved. This work presents a
comprehensive analysis of the design and performance optimization of a Quantum
Random Number Generator (QRNG) based on Bell inequality violations. We
investigate key protocol parameters, including the smoothing parameter
($\epsilon_{\text{s}}$), test round probability ($\gamma$), and switching
delays, and their effects on the generation rate and quality of randomness. We
identify optimal ranges for $\gamma$ and $p_\Omega$ (the protocol's
non-aborting probability) to balance the trade-off between randomness
consumption and net randomness generation. Additionally, we explore the impact
of switching delays on the system's performance, providing strategies to
mitigate these effects. Our results indicate substantial developments in QRNG
implementations and offer higher randomness expansion rates. The work provides
practical guidelines for the efficient and secure design of QRNG systems and
other cryptographic protocols.

**Abstract**: Quantum speed limit is a fundamental speed limit for the evolution of quantum
states. It is the single-most important interpretation of the time energy
uncertainty relation. Recently the speed limit of quantum correlations have
been proposed like the concurrence for pure quantum states. In this direction,
we derive a speed limit bound for a quantum correlation named the concurrence
for the generally mixed quantum states of two qubits. By this we mean that we
find an expression for the minimum time required to reach a given value of
entanglement starting from an arbitrary initial generally mixed state. We
discuss the connection of the findings of this article in the interdisciplinary
area of the condensed matter physics or the many body physics and quantum
information science such as on the topic of Lieb-Robinson bound in a
quantitative manner.

**Abstract**: The generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) equation is the equivalent of the Euler
equations of hydrodynamics for integrable models. Systems of hyperbolic
equations such as the Euler equations usually develop shocks and are plagued by
problems of uniqueness. We establish for the first time the existence and
uniqueness of solutions to the full GHD equation and the absence of shocks,
from a large class of initial conditions with bounded occupation function. We
assume only absolute integrability of the two-body scattering shift. In
applications to quantum models of fermionic type, this includes all commonly
used physical initial states, such as locally thermal states and zero-entropy
states. We show in particular that differentiable initial conditions give
differentiable solutions at all times and that weak initial conditions such as
the Riemann problem have unique weak solutions which preserve entropy. For this
purpose, we write the GHD equation as a new fixed-point problem (announced in a
companion paper). We show that the fixed point exists, is unique, and is
approached, under an iterative solution procedure, in the Banach topology on
functions of momenta.


### Efficient quantum pseudorandomness under conservation laws

**Abstract**: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture
statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of
wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there
are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently
important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most
notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental
difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local
symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at
most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit
constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work,
we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries
by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to
converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination
of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct
application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal
random covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in
[PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].


### Machine learning and optimization-based approaches to duality in statistical physics
**Authors**: Andrea E. V. Ferrari, Prateek Gupta, Nabil Iqbal

**Abstract**: The notion of duality -- that a given physical system can have two different
mathematical descriptions -- is a key idea in modern theoretical physics.
Establishing a duality in lattice statistical mechanics models requires the
construction of a dual Hamiltonian and a map from the original to the dual
observables. By using simple neural networks to parameterize these maps and
introducing a loss function that penalises the difference between correlation
functions in original and dual models, we formulate the process of duality
discovery as an optimization problem. We numerically solve this problem and
show that our framework can rediscover the celebrated Kramers-Wannier duality
for the 2d Ising model, reconstructing the known mapping of temperatures. We
also discuss an alternative approach which uses known features of the mapping
of topological lines to reduce the problem to optimizing the couplings in a
dual Hamiltonian, and explore next-to-nearest neighbour deformations of the 2d
Ising duality. We discuss future directions and prospects for discovering new
dualities within this framework.


### Collisionless conduction in a high-beta plasma: a collision operator for whistler turbulence
**Authors**: Evan L. Yerger, Matthew W. Kunz, Archie F. A. Bott, Anatoly Spitkovsky

**Abstract**: The regulation of electron heat transport in high-beta, weakly collisional,
magnetized plasma is investigated. A temperature gradient oriented along a mean
magnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability
(HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding
their flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat
flux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These
numerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large
fluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at
astrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell
simulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient
length scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in
all of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling,
supporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to
develop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision
operator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the
standard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the
well-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community. Despite
this limitation, the methods developed here can serve as a blueprint for future
work seeking to characterize the effective collisionality caused by kinetic
instabilities.


### Si/SiO$_\text{2}$ MOSFET Reliability Physics: From Four-State Model to All-State Model
**Authors**: Xinjing Guo, Menglin Huang, Shiyou Chen

**Published Date**: 2024-11-07

**Updated Date**: 2024-11-07

**PDF Url**: [2411.04823v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04823v1)

**Abstract**: As implemented in the commercialized device modeling software, the four-state
nonradiative multi-phonon model has attracted intensive attention in the past
decade for describing the physics in negative bias temperature instability
(NBTI) and other reliability issues of Si/SiO$_\text{2}$ MOSFET devices. It was
proposed initially based on the assumption that the oxygen vacancy defects
(V$_\text{O}$) in SiO$_\text{2}$ dielectric layer are bistable in the Si-dimer
and back-projected structures during carrier capture and emission. Through
high-throughput first-principles structural search, we found V$_\text{O}$ on
non-equivalent O sites in amorphous SiO$_\text{2}$ can take 4 types of
structural configurations in neutral state and 7 types of configurations in +1
charged state after capturing holes, which produce a wide range of charge-state
transition levels for trapping holes. The finding contrasts the
structural-bistability assumption and makes the four-state model invalid for
most of O sites. To describe the reliability physics accurately, we propose an
all-state model to consider all these structural configurations as well as all
the carrier capture/emission transitions and thermal transitions between them.
With the all-state model, we show that the V$_\text{O}$ defects play important
roles in causing NBTI, which challenges the recent studies that discarded
V$_\text{O}$ as a possible hole trap in NBTI. Our systematical calculations on
the diversified V$_\text{O}$ properties and the all-state model provide the
microscopic foundation for describing the reliability physics of MOSFETs and
other transistors accurately.


## Diffusion
### SVDQunat: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Components for 4-Bit Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Muyang Li, Yujun Lin, Zhekai Zhang, Tianle Cai, Xiuyu Li, Junxian Guo, Enze Xie, Chenlin Meng, Jun-Yan Zhu, Song Han

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality
images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more
memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for
deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing
their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both
weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training
quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become
insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit
quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers
between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a
low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from
activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in
the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases
the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank
branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of
activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design
an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into
those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also
seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for
re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1
validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce
the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving
3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB
laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs. Our
quantization library and inference engine are open-sourced.


### Diff-2-in-1: Bridging Generation and Dense Perception with Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Beyond high-fidelity image synthesis, diffusion models have recently
exhibited promising results in dense visual perception tasks. However, most
existing work treats diffusion models as a standalone component for perception
tasks, employing them either solely for off-the-shelf data augmentation or as
mere feature extractors. In contrast to these isolated and thus sub-optimal
efforts, we introduce a unified, versatile, diffusion-based framework,
Diff-2-in-1, that can simultaneously handle both multi-modal data generation
and dense visual perception, through a unique exploitation of the
diffusion-denoising process. Within this framework, we further enhance
discriminative visual perception via multi-modal generation, by utilizing the
denoising network to create multi-modal data that mirror the distribution of
the original training set. Importantly, Diff-2-in-1 optimizes the utilization
of the created diverse and faithful data by leveraging a novel self-improving
learning mechanism. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the
effectiveness of our framework, showcasing consistent performance improvements
across various discriminative backbones and high-quality multi-modal data
generation characterized by both realism and usefulness.


### ReCapture: Generative Video Camera Controls for User-Provided Videos using Masked Video Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: David Junhao Zhang, Roni Paiss, Shiran Zada, Nikhil Karnad, David E. Jacobs, Yael Pritch, Inbar Mosseri, Mike Zheng Shou, Neal Wadhwa, Nataniel Ruiz

**Abstract**: Recently, breakthroughs in video modeling have allowed for controllable
camera trajectories in generated videos. However, these methods cannot be
directly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video
model. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos
with novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method
allows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene
motion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably,
using our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were
not observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a
noisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion
models or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the
anchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our
proposed masked video fine-tuning technique.


### SG-I2V: Self-Guided Trajectory Control in Image-to-Video Generation

**Abstract**: Methods for image-to-video generation have achieved impressive,
photo-realistic quality. However, adjusting specific elements in generated
videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of
trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random
seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model
to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories.
Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it
requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to
procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable
image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering
zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained
image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external
knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while being
competitive with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion
fidelity.


### Uncovering Hidden Subspaces in Video Diffusion Models Using Re-Identification

**Abstract**: Latent Video Diffusion Models can easily deceive casual observers and domain
experts alike thanks to the produced image quality and temporal consistency.
Beyond entertainment, this creates opportunities around safe data sharing of
fully synthetic datasets, which are crucial in healthcare, as well as other
domains relying on sensitive personal information. However, privacy concerns
with this approach have not fully been addressed yet, and models trained on
synthetic data for specific downstream tasks still perform worse than those
trained on real data. This discrepancy may be partly due to the sampling space
being a subspace of the training videos, effectively reducing the training data
size for downstream models. Additionally, the reduced temporal consistency when
generating long videos could be a contributing factor.
  In this paper, we first show that training privacy-preserving models in
latent space is computationally more efficient and generalize better.
Furthermore, to investigate downstream degradation factors, we propose to use a
re-identification model, previously employed as a privacy preservation filter.
We demonstrate that it is sufficient to train this model on the latent space of
the video generator. Subsequently, we use these models to evaluate the subspace
covered by synthetic video datasets and thus introduce a new way to measure the
faithfulness of generative machine learning models. We focus on a specific
application in healthcare echocardiography to illustrate the effectiveness of
our novel methods. Our findings indicate that only up to 30.8% of the training
videos are learned in latent video diffusion models, which could explain the
lack of performance when training downstream tasks on synthetic data.
