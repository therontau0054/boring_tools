**Abstract**: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics,
referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a
system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The
original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has
been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to
extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a
Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of
coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the
system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and
generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of
excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within
the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band
experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the
bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band
inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our
numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from
exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven
topological phases of matter.

**Abstract**: Real-time propagation methods for chemistry and physics are invariably
formulated using variational techniques. The time-dependent bivariational
principle (TD-BIVP) is known to be the proper framework for coupled-cluster
type methods, and is here studied from a differential geometric point of view.
It is demonstrated how two distinct classical Hamilton's equations of motion
arise from considering the real and imaginary parts of the action integral. The
latter is new, and can in principle be used to develop novel propagation
methods. Conservation laws and Poisson brackets are introduced, completing the
analogy with classical mechanics. An overview of established real-time
propagation methods is given in the context of our formulation of the TD-BIVP,
namely time-dependent traditional coupled-cluster theory, orbital-adaptive
coupled-cluster theory, time-dependent orthogonal optimized coupled-cluster
theory, and equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory.


### Neutrino quantum kinetics in two spatial dimensions

**Abstract**: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the innermost regions of
core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers is mostly limited to
spherically symmetric configurations that facilitate the numerical solution of
the quantum kinetic equations. In this paper, we simulate neutrino quantum
kinetics within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: we model the flavor evolution
during neutrino decoupling from matter in two spatial dimensions, one neutrino
momentum variable, and time; taking into account non-forward neutral current
and charged current collisions of neutrinos with the matter background, as well
as neutrino advection. In order to mimic fluctuations in the neutrino emission
and matter background, and explore their effect on the flavor evolution, we
introduce perturbations in the collision term as well as in the vacuum term of
the Hamiltonian. Because of such perturbations, the initial symmetry of the
neutrino field across the simulation annulus is broken and flavor conversion is
qualitatively affected, with regions of larger flavor conversion alternating
across the simulation annulus. In addition, neutrino advection is responsible
for spreading flavor waves across neighboring spatial regions. Although based
on a simplified setup, our findings highlight the importance of modeling
neutrino quantum kinetics in multi-dimensions to assess the impact of neutrinos
on the physics of compact astrophysical sources and nucleosynthesis.


### The Importance of Being Scalable: Improving the Speed and Accuracy of Neural Network Interatomic Potentials Across Chemical Domains
**Authors**: Eric Qu, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan

**Abstract**: Scaling has been critical in improving model performance and generalization
in machine learning. It involves how a model's performance changes with
increases in model size or input data, as well as how efficiently computational
resources are utilized to support this growth. Despite successes in other
areas, the study of scaling in Neural Network Interatomic Potentials (NNIPs)
remains limited. NNIPs act as surrogate models for ab initio quantum mechanical
calculations. The dominant paradigm here is to incorporate many physical domain
constraints into the model, such as rotational equivariance. We contend that
these complex constraints inhibit the scaling ability of NNIPs, and are likely
to lead to performance plateaus in the long run. In this work, we take an
alternative approach and start by systematically studying NNIP scaling
strategies. Our findings indicate that scaling the model through attention
mechanisms is efficient and improves model expressivity. These insights
motivate us to develop an NNIP architecture designed for scalability: the
Efficiently Scaled Attention Interatomic Potential (EScAIP). EScAIP leverages a
multi-head self-attention formulation within graph neural networks, applying
attention at the neighbor-level representations. Implemented with
highly-optimized attention GPU kernels, EScAIP achieves substantial gains in
efficiency--at least 10x faster inference, 5x less memory usage--compared to
existing NNIPs. EScAIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide
range of datasets including catalysts (OC20 and OC22), molecules (SPICE), and
materials (MPTrj). We emphasize that our approach should be thought of as a
philosophy rather than a specific model, representing a proof-of-concept for
developing general-purpose NNIPs that achieve better expressivity through
scaling, and continue to scale efficiently with increased computational
resources and training data.


### Arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies
**Authors**: Marco de Cesare

**PDF Url**: [2405.01380v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01380v2)

**Abstract**: Different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum cosmology and
group field theory, predict the resolution of the initial cosmological
singularity via a bounce: a regular spacetime region that connects the
expanding branch of the universe to a contracting branch. The cosmological
arrow of time, which by definition points in the direction of cosmic expansion,
is reversed at the bounce. Nonetheless, it is still possible to discriminate
between the two branches by considering different arrows, as defined for
instance by the growth of perturbations. After reviewing general aspects of the
time arrow problem in cosmology, we examine the properties of different arrows
of time in bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the loop quantum cosmology bounce
as a case study. These issues are examined in detail for an exact solution to
the effective Friedmann equations of loop quantum cosmology with pressureless
dust and a cosmological constant, which is a simplified version of the
$\Lambda$CDM bounce scenario.


### 2D magnetic stability
**Authors**: Douglas Lundholm

**Published Date**: 2024-10-31

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-31

**PDF Url**: [2410.24156v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24156v1)

**Abstract**: This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the 33rd/35th
International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP,
Group33/35) held in Cotonou, Benin, July 15-19, 2024. The stability of matter
is an old and mathematically difficult problem, relying both on the uncertainty
principle of quantum mechanics and on the exclusion principle of quantum
statistics. We consider here the stability of the self-interacting
almost-bosonic anyon gas, generalizing the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear
Schr\"odinger energy functionals to include magnetic self interactions. We show
that there is a type of supersymmetry in the model which holds only for higher
values of the magnetic coupling but is broken for lower values, and that in the
former case supersymmetric ground states exist precisely at even-integer
quantized values of the coupling. These states constitute a manifold of
explicit solitonic vortex solutions whose densities solve a generalized
Liouville equation, and can be regarded as nonlinear generalizations of Landau
levels. The reported work is joint with Alireza Ataei and Dinh-Thi Nguyen and
makes an earlier analysis of self-dual abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory by
Jackiw and Pi, Hagen, and others, mathematically rigorous.


### Modeling Brownian Motion as a Timelapse of the Physical, Persistent, Trajectory
**Authors**: Ludovico Cademartiri

**Abstract**: While it is very common to model diffusion as a random walk by assuming
memorylessness of the trajectory and diffusive step lengths, these assumptions
can lead to significant errors. This paper describes the extent to which a
physical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight.
Analysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over
collisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures
the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two
observations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when
the time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the
distribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly
smaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the
combination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at
short timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the
underlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical
trajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of
the subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is
several hundred times larger than the relaxation time. I discuss how to best
account for this effect in computational approaches.

**Abstract**: The development of ultra-low emittance storage rings, such as the e+/e-
Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) with a circumference of about 90 km, aims to
achieve unprecedented luminosity and beam size. One significant challenge is
correcting the optics, which becomes increasingly difficult as we target lower
emittances. In this paper, we investigate optics correction methods to address
these challenges. We examined the impact of arc region magnet alignment errors
in the baseline optics for the FCC-ee lattice at Z energy. To establish
realistic alignment tolerances, we developed a sequence of correction steps
using the Python Accelerator Toolbox (PyAT) to correct the lattice optics,
achieve the nominal emittance, Dynamic Aperture (DA), and in the end, the
design luminosity. The correction scheme has been recently optimized and better
machine performance demonstrated. A comparison was conducted between two optics
correction approaches: Linear Optics from Closed Orbits (LOCO) with phase
advance + $\eta_x$ and coupling Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) + $\eta_y$. The
latter method demonstrated better performance in achieving the target emittance
and enhancing the DA.

**Abstract**: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum
information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class
of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this
framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with
non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness
compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture.
In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable
condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their
spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have
applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and
the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.

**Abstract**: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the
astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific
simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The
proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for
the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an
arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of
functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation
routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper
presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for
further developments.

### Bridging Geometric States via Geometric Diffusion Bridge
**Authors**: Shengjie Luo, Yixian Xu, Di He, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-10-31

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-31

**PDF Url**: [2410.24220v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24220v1)

**Abstract**: The accurate prediction of geometric state evolution in complex systems is
critical for advancing scientific domains such as quantum chemistry and
material modeling. Traditional experimental and computational methods face
challenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands,
while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision
and generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge
(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial
and target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve
geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge
derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric
states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target
geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition
kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB
framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more
detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we
conduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve
joint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the
underlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.
Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB
surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for
accurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges
with improved accuracy and applicability.


### DiffPano: Scalable and Consistent Text to Panorama Generation with Spherical Epipolar-Aware Diffusion

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable achievements in 2D image or
3D object generation, however, the generation of 3D scenes and even
$360^{\circ}$ images remains constrained, due to the limited number of scene
datasets, the complexity of 3D scenes themselves, and the difficulty of
generating consistent multi-view images. To address these issues, we first
establish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset containing millions of
consecutive panoramic keyframes with corresponding panoramic depths, camera
poses, and text descriptions. Then, we propose a novel text-driven panoramic
generation framework, termed DiffPano, to achieve scalable, consistent, and
diverse panoramic scene generation. Specifically, benefiting from the powerful
generative capabilities of stable diffusion, we fine-tune a single-view
text-to-panorama diffusion model with LoRA on the established panoramic
video-text dataset. We further design a spherical epipolar-aware multi-view
diffusion model to ensure the multi-view consistency of the generated panoramic
images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPano can generate scalable,
consistent, and diverse panoramic images with given unseen text descriptions
and camera poses.


### Invisible Image Watermarks Are Provably Removable Using Generative AI

**Abstract**: Invisible watermarks safeguard images' copyrights by embedding hidden
messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing
images, especially those generated by AI models. We propose a family of
regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack
method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then
reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with
many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such
as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations,
we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to this
regeneration attack. Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-level
watermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superior
performance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection rates
and higher image quality. However, watermarks that keep the image semantically
similar can be an alternative defense against our attacks. Our finding
underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible
watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks. Code is available at

### AR-Pro: Counterfactual Explanations for Anomaly Repair with Formal Properties

**Abstract**: Anomaly detection is widely used for identifying critical errors and
suspicious behaviors, but current methods lack interpretability. We leverage
common properties of existing methods and recent advances in generative models
to introduce counterfactual explanations for anomaly detection. Given an input,
we generate its counterfactual as a diffusion-based repair that shows what a
non-anomalous version should have looked like. A key advantage of this approach
is that it enables a domain-independent formal specification of explainability
desiderata, offering a unified framework for generating and evaluating
explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our anomaly explainability
framework, AR-Pro, on vision (MVTec, VisA) and time-series (SWaT, WADI, HAI)
anomaly datasets. The code used for the experiments is accessible at:

**Abstract**: A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure
of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a
generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained
on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction
pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic
cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the
information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find
that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small
as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity,
including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can
successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five
times, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by
post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving
structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments.
We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical
simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of
previously unsolved nano-materials.
