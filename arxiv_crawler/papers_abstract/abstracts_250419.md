**Abstract**: We propose a distinct approach to solving linear and nonlinear differential
equations (DEs) on quantum computers by encoding the problem into ground states
of effective Hamiltonian operators. Our algorithm relies on constructing such
operators in the Chebyshev space, where an effective Hamiltonian is a sum of
global differential and data constraints. Once the effective Hamiltonian is
formed, solutions of differential equations can be obtained using the ground
state preparation techniques (e.g. imaginary-time evolution and quantum
singular value transformation), bypassing variational search. Unlike approaches
based on discrete grids, the algorithm enables evaluation of solutions beyond
fixed grid points and implements constraints in the physics-informed way. Our
proposal inherits the best traits from quantum machine learning-based DE
solving (compact basis representation, automatic differentiation, nonlinearity)
and quantum linear algebra-based approaches (fine-grid encoding, provable
speed-up for state preparation), offering a robust strategy for quantum
scientific computing in the early fault-tolerant era.

**Abstract**: Entanglement, a key resource of emerging quantum technologies, describes
correlations between particles that defy classical physics. It has been studied
extensively on various platforms, but has remained elusive in electron
microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for
materials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide
control over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with
largely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations.
Here, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via
cathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing
coincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we
reconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission
masks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of
the classical uncertainty bound: $\Delta x_-^2 \Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \pm
0.047<1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the
continuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields
of electron microscopy and quantum optics. Our work paves the way for exploring
quantum correlations in free-electron systems and their application to
quantum-enhanced imaging techniques on the nanoscale.

**Abstract**: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it
traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into
parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit
the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the
generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface
approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with
combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint
analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34}
\times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\%
confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} < 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint
is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the
inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading
constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization
and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to
parity-violating effects in the early universe.

**Abstract**: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important
issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the
characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the
paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the
basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the
idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for
switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow
model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example
of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten
digits from the MNIST data set.

**PDF Url**: [2504.13144v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13144v1)

**Abstract**: Accurate comparisons between theoretical models and experimental data are
critical for scientific progress. However, inferred model parameters can vary
significantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of
properly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this article, we
explicitly incorporate these uncertainties using Gaussian processes that model
the domain of validity of theoretical models, integrating prior knowledge about
where a theory applies and where it does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and
multi-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model
discrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements
observed as additional experimental observables are integrated.

**PDF Url**: [2504.13135v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13135v1)

**Abstract**: We study the forms of CP-violating (CPV) neutral triple gauge couplings
(nTGCs) that can be realized via dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We present a new formulation of the CPV nTGC
form factors that is compatible with the spontaneous breaking of the
electroweak gauge symmetry, and show how these CPV form factors can be matched
consistently with the corresponding dimension-8 CPV nTGC operators in the
broken phase. We then study probes of the CPV nTGCs at future high-energy
$e^+e^-$ colliders with centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = (0.25, 0.5,1, 3,
5)$TeV respectively, demonstrating that the $e^{\mp}$ beam polarizations can
help to improve the sensitivities of probes of the nTGCs. We estimate that the
sensitivities for probing the new physics scales of the nTGCs can range from
${O}(\rm{TeV})$ at a 250GeV $e^+e^-$ collider to ${O}(10\rm{TeV})$ at a 5TeV
$e^+e^-$ collider, and that the sensitivities to form factors range from
${O}(10^{-4})$ to ${O}(10^{-8})$.


### Feedforward suppression of readout-induced faults in quantum error correction

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-17

**PDF Url**: [2504.13083v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13083v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a method to reduce readout-induced faults, applicable in settings
like quantum error correction with repeated measurement cycles. The method
consists of an adaptive readout sequence conditioned on each check qubit's
readout result from the previous cycle. For readout errors and
measurement-induced leakage that are stronger in a particular qubit state, this
feedforward protocol can suppress the physical qubit errors. Focusing on a
simple realization of conditionally flipping (by an X gate) the state of check
qubits before their measurement, we investigate the effect of such
state-dependent errors using simulations in the setup of a low-density parity
check code. We show that the suggested protocol can reduce both logical errors
and decoding time, two important aspects of fault-tolerant quantum
computations.

**Abstract**: Precision measurements of Higgs boson differential production cross sections
are a key tool to probe the properties of the Higgs boson and test the standard
model. New physics can affect both Higgs boson production and decay, leading to
deviations from the distributions that are expected in the standard model. In
this paper, combined measurements of differential spectra in a fiducial region
matching the experimental selections are performed, based on analyses of four
Higgs boson decay channels ($\gamma\gamma$, ZZ$^{(*)}$, WW$^{(*)}$, and
$\tau\tau$) using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector
at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138
fb$^{-1}$. The differential measurements are extrapolated to the full phase
space and combined to provide the differential spectra. A measurement of the
total Higgs boson production cross section is also performed using the
$\gamma\gamma$ and ZZ decay channels, with a result of 53.4$^{+2.9}_{-2.9}$
(stat)$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ (syst) pb, consistent with the standard model prediction
of 55.6 $\pm$ 2.5 pb. The fiducial measurements are used to compute limits on
Higgs boson couplings using the $\kappa$-framework and the SM effective field
theory.

**Abstract**: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength
volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive
responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme
localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of
local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and
reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform
optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in
nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF)
confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be
inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a
deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and
spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF
spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an
information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this
extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning
the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical
resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a
speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral
acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle
demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy
achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy
techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic
applications and next-generation microscopies.

**Abstract**: Quantum entanglement is central to both the foundations of quantum mechanics
and the development of new technologies in information processing,
communication, and sensing. Entanglement has been realised in a variety of
physical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and
hybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free
electrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have
never been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum
entanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is
produced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a
nanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied
to the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct
the full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the
Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard
deviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron
quantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron
imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. More broadly, the
ability to generate and measure entanglement opens electron microscopy to
previously inaccessible quantum observables and correlations in solids and
nanostructures.

**Abstract**: This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC
Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks:
(i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image
Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of
lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an
emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and
other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA
competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for
single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800
synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images,
which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of
8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that
benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and
TikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final
submissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the
progress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is
publicly available at https://github.com/lixinustc/KVQE-

**Abstract**: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified
garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more
challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,
lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers
multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it
improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin
color. Code is available at: https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff/

**Abstract**: Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a
variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient,
struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not
naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast,
agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from
demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are
rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning,
achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To
overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that
is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The
key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG)
technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the
robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG
minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the
sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating
KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In
simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in
table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation
learning baselines.


### ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models
**Authors**: Linkang Du, Zheng Zhu, Min Chen, Zhou Su, Shouling Ji, Peng Cheng, Jiming Chen, Zhikun Zhang

**Abstract**: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

**Abstract**: Diffusion models represent a powerful family of generative models widely used
for image and video generation. However, the time-consuming deployment, long
inference time, and requirements on large memory hinder their applications on
resource constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a method based on the
improved Straight-Through Estimator to improve the deployment efficiency of
diffusion models. Specifically, we add sparse masks to the Convolution and
Linear layers in a pre-trained diffusion model, then transfer learn the sparse
model during the fine-tuning stage and turn on the sparse masks during
inference. Experimental results on a Transformer and UNet-based diffusion
models demonstrate that our method reduces MACs by 50% while maintaining FID.
Sparse models are accelerated by approximately 1.2x on the GPU. Under other
MACs conditions, the FID is also lower than 1 compared to other methods.
