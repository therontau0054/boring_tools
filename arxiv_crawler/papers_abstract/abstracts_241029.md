**Abstract**: We highlight the need for global completion of the field content in the
M5-brane sigma-model analogous to Dirac's charge/flux quantization, and we
point out that the superspace Bianchi identities on the worldvolume and on its
ambient supergravity background constrain the M5's flux-quantization law to be
in a non-abelian cohomology theory rationally equivalent to a twisted form of
co-Homotopy. In order to clearly bring out this subtle point we give a
streamlined re-derivation of the worldvolume 3-flux via M5 "super-embeddings".
Finally, assuming the flux-quantization law to actually be in co-Homotopy
("Hypothesis H") we show how this implies Skyrmion-like solitons on general
M5-worldvolumes and (abelian) anyonic solitons on the boundaries of "open
M5-branes" in heterotic M-theory.

**Abstract**: It is shown how spin one vector matter fields can be coupled to a Yang-Mills
theory. Such matter fields are defined as belonging to a representation $R$ of
the Yang-Mills gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. It is also demanded that these
fields together with the original gauge fields be the gauge fields of an
embedding total gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\rm tot}$. The existence of a
physically consistent Yang-Mills action for the total algebra is finally
required. These conditions are rather restrictive, as shown in some examples:
non-trivial solutions may or may not exist depending on the choice of the
original algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and of the representation $R$. The case of the
initial algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ = $\mathfrak{u}(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is
treated in more detail.


### Efficient time dependent Wannier functions for ultrafast dynamics

**PDF Url**: [2410.21230v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21230v1)

**Abstract**: Time-dependent Wannier functions were initially proposed as a means for
calculating the polarization current in crystals driven by external fields. In
this work, we present a simple gauge where Wannier states are defined based on
the maximally localized functions at the initial time, and are propagated using
the time-dependent Bloch states obtained from established first-principles
calculations, avoiding the costly Wannierization at ech time step. We show that
this basis efficiently describes the time-dependent polarization of the laser
driven system through the analysis of the motion of Wannier centers. We use
this technique to analyze highly nonlinear and non-perturbative responses such
as high harmonic generation in solids, using the hexagonal boron nitride as an
illustrative example, and we show how it provides an intuitive picture for the
physical mechanisms.


### Learning to Walk from Three Minutes of Real-World Data with Semi-structured Dynamics Models
**Authors**: Jacob Levy, Tyler Westenbroek, David Fridovich-Keil

**PDF Url**: [2410.09163v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09163v2)

**Abstract**: Traditionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods exploit
neural networks as flexible function approximators to represent $\textit{a
priori}$ unknown environment dynamics. However, training data are typically
scarce in practice, and these black-box models often fail to generalize.
Modeling architectures that leverage known physics can substantially reduce the
complexity of system-identification, but break down in the face of complex
phenomena such as contact. We introduce a novel framework for learning
semi-structured dynamics models for contact-rich systems which seamlessly
integrates structured first principles modeling techniques with black-box
auto-regressive models. Specifically, we develop an ensemble of probabilistic
models to estimate external forces, conditioned on historical observations and
actions, and integrate these predictions using known Lagrangian dynamics. With
this semi-structured approach, we can make accurate long-horizon predictions
with substantially less data than prior methods. We leverage this capability
and propose Semi-Structured Reinforcement Learning ($\texttt{SSRL}$) a simple
model-based learning framework which pushes the sample complexity boundary for
real-world learning. We validate our approach on a real-world Unitree Go1
quadruped robot, learning dynamic gaits -- from scratch -- on both hard and
soft surfaces with just a few minutes of real-world data. Video and code are

### Noise robustness and threshold of many-body quantum magic
**Authors**: Fuchuan Wei, Zi-Wen Liu

**Published Date**: 2024-10-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-28

**PDF Url**: [2410.21215v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21215v1)

**Abstract**: Understanding quantum magic (i.e., nonstabilizerness) in many-body quantum
systems is challenging but essential to the study of quantum computation and
many-body physics. We investigate how noise affects magic properties in
entangled many-body quantum states by quantitatively examining the magic decay
under noise, with a primary aim being to understand the stability of magic
associated with different kinds of entanglement structures. As a standard
model, we study hypergraph states, a representative class of many-body magic
states, subject to depolarizing noise. First, we show that interactions
facilitated by high-degree gates are fragile to noise. In particular, the
$\mathrm{C}^{n-1}Z$ state family exhibits a vanishing magic threshold of
$\Theta(1/n)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficiently preparable families of
hypergraph states without local magic but with a non-vanishing magic threshold
which signifies robust magic that is entirely embedded in global entanglement.
We also discuss the qudit case based on the discrete Wigner formalism.


### Fermionic Casimir Energy in Horava-Lifshitz Scenario
**Authors**: E. R. Bezerra de Mello, M. B. Cruz

**Published Date**: 2024-07-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-28

**PDF Url**: [2407.11749v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11749v2)

**Abstract**: In this work, we investigate the violation of Lorentz symmetry through the
Casimir effect. The Casimir effect is one of the most intriguing aspects of
modern physics, representing a macroscopic quantum-origin force between two
neutral conducting surfaces, and it stands as a triumph of Quantum Field
Theory. Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive
fermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel
plates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To
calculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a
MIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order
derivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results indicate a strong
influence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the
Casimir energy is affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially exhibiting
repulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical
exponent associated with the Horava-Lifshitz formalism.


### $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing from nonlocal condensate contributions
**Authors**: Lovro Dulibić, Blaženka Melić, Alexey A. Petrov

**Published Date**: 2024-10-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-28

**PDF Url**: [2410.14382v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14382v2)

**Abstract**: A significant discrepancy, spanning multiple orders of magnitude, exists
between the leading order contribution to the $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing
parameters and experimental values. This is largely due to the
Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, which results in substantial
suppression of the theoretical predictions. To bridge this gap, various efforts
have been made to account for higher-order terms and nonperturbative effects,
which, although suppressed in the operator product expansion (OPE), could
potentially lead to a larger contribution by weakening the GIM cancellation
through flavour SU(3) symmetry breaking. In this work, we compute the
long-distance contributions of nonlocal QCD condensates within different models
and, for the first time, determine the impact of the mixed condensate. Although
our results still fall short of the experimental value, they represent an
improvement over current theoretical estimates by an order of magnitude.


### The pathway to chirality in elemental tellurium

**Abstract**: Chiral crystals, like chiral molecules, cannot be superimposed onto their
mirror images -- a fundamental property that has been linked to interesting
physical behavior and exploited in functional devices. Among the simplest
inorganic systems with crystallographic chirality, elemental tellurium adopts
crystal structures with right- or left-handed chains. However, understanding
the formation mechanisms of those structures has been difficult due to the
rapid crystallization of Te, which reaches the spatial and temporal resolution
limits of even the most advanced experiments. Here, we report
ultra-large-scale, quantum-mechanically accurate simulations that reveal
mechanisms of crystallization and the origin of crystallographic chirality in
solid Te. We identify a characteristic, disordered cube-like structural motif
-- a transient bonding environment with only nanosecond lifetime -- that
enables both the rapid crystallization of Te and mediates chirality transfer.
Based on the resulting microscopic understanding, we are able to explain the
switching behavior of Te-based electrical devices.

**Abstract**: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory
is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types
according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In
this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically
interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the
gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory
based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the
theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while
focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we
perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the
theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new
behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not
to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of
the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers.
The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five,
and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under
a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case.
Finally, we conclude this work with several future perspectives.

**Abstract**: Molecular sorting in biological membranes is essential for proper cellular
function. It also plays a crucial role in the budding of enveloped viruses from
host cells. We recently proposed that this process is driven by phase
separation, where the formation and growth of sorting domains depend primarily
on short-range intermolecular interactions. In addition to these, Casimir-like
forces -- arising from entropic effects in fluctuating membranes and acting on
longer ranges -- may also play a significant role in the molecular distillation
process. Here, using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations, we explore how these forces contribute to sorting, particularly in
the biologically relevant regime where short-range intermolecular interactions
are weak. Our results show that Casimir-like forces enhance molecular
distillation by reducing the critical radius for the formation of new sorting
domains and facilitating the capture of molecules within these domains. We
identify the relative rigidity of the membrane and supermolecular domains as a
key parameter controlling molecular sorting efficiency, offering new insights
into the physical principles underlying molecular sorting in biological
systems.

**Abstract**: Diffusion models, praised for their success in generative tasks, are
increasingly being applied to robotics, demonstrating exceptional performance
in behavior cloning. However, their slow generation process stemming from
iterative denoising steps poses a challenge for real-time applications in
resource-constrained robotics setups and dynamically changing environments. In
this paper, we introduce the One-Step Diffusion Policy (OneDP), a novel
approach that distills knowledge from pre-trained diffusion policies into a
single-step action generator, significantly accelerating response times for
robotic control tasks. We ensure the distilled generator closely aligns with
the original policy distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence along the diffusion chain, requiring only $2\%$-$10\%$ additional
pre-training cost for convergence. We evaluated OneDP on 6 challenging
simulation tasks as well as 4 self-designed real-world tasks using the Franka
robot. The results demonstrate that OneDP not only achieves state-of-the-art
success rates but also delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in inference
speed, boosting action prediction frequency from 1.5 Hz to 62 Hz, establishing
its potential for dynamic and computationally constrained robotic applications.

### Customizing Text-to-Image Models with a Single Image Pair
**Authors**: Maxwell Jones, Sheng-Yu Wang, Nupur Kumari, David Bau, Jun-Yan Zhu

**PDF Url**: [2405.01536v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01536v2)

**Abstract**: Art reinterpretation is the practice of creating a variation of a reference
work, making a paired artwork that exhibits a distinct artistic style. We ask
if such an image pair can be used to customize a generative model to capture
the demonstrated stylistic difference. We propose Pair Customization, a new
customization method that learns stylistic difference from a single image pair
and then applies the acquired style to the generation process. Unlike existing
methods that learn to mimic a single concept from a collection of images, our
method captures the stylistic difference between paired images. This allows us
to apply a stylistic change without overfitting to the specific image content
in the examples. To address this new task, we employ a joint optimization
method that explicitly separates the style and content into distinct LoRA
weight spaces. We optimize these style and content weights to reproduce the
style and content images while encouraging their orthogonality. During
inference, we modify the diffusion process via a new style guidance based on
our learned weights. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that
our method can effectively learn style while avoiding overfitting to image
content, highlighting the potential of modeling such stylistic differences from
a single image pair.


### On learning higher-order cumulants in diffusion models
**Authors**: Gert Aarts, Diaa E. Habibi, Lingxiao Wang, Kai Zhou

**Published Date**: 2024-10-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-28

**PDF Url**: [2410.21212v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21212v1)

**Abstract**: To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we
study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions,
under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for
the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution
of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically
that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models
without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the
endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We
demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function,
higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting
from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable
toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.


### Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation

**PDF Url**: [2310.03739v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03739v3)

**Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged at the forefront of
image generation, powered by very large-scale unsupervised or weakly supervised
text-to-image training datasets. Due to their unsupervised training,
controlling their behavior in downstream tasks, such as maximizing
human-perceived image quality, image-text alignment, or ethical image
generation, is difficult. Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstream
reward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the high
variance of the gradient estimators. In this paper, we propose AlignProp, a
method that aligns diffusion models to downstream reward functions using
end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient through the denoising
process. While naive implementation of such backpropagation would require
prohibitive memory resources for storing the partial derivatives of modern
text-to-image models, AlignProp finetunes low-rank adapter weight modules and
uses gradient checkpointing, to render its memory usage viable. We test
AlignProp in finetuning diffusion models to various objectives, such as
image-text semantic alignment, aesthetics, compressibility and controllability
of the number of objects present, as well as their combinations. We show
AlignProp achieves higher rewards in fewer training steps than alternatives,
while being conceptually simpler, making it a straightforward choice for
optimizing diffusion models for differentiable reward functions of interest.

**Abstract**: Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging
problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural
stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling
technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of
an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural
SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their
scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching
(TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing
backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique
from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish
necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a
reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt
TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on
three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and
uncertainty prediction.
