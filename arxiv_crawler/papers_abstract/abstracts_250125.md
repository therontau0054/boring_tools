**Abstract**: With the rapid development of diffusion models, text-to-image(T2I) models
have made significant progress, showcasing impressive abilities in prompt
following and image generation. Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and
Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising
questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose
applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit
capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image
editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision
tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current
evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models'
performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we
developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0,
Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided
into five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical
consistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and
multi-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each
model's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of
FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring
the expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI
tools. This study provides valuable insights into the current state and future
trajectory of T2I models as they evolve towards general-purpose usability.

**Abstract**: Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from
the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here
determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We
consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional
walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard
wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary
induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates
into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp
differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of
the quantum walker. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems
share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics
of one of them.

**Abstract**: This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$
gravity solutions for a scalar field source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity
field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case added by a scalar field
to find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For $k=0$, we find an
easy-to-compute $F(T)$ solution formula applicable for any scalar field source.
Then, we obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F(T)$
solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values and well-determined scalar
field cases. We can find by those computations a large number of analytical
teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions independent of any scalar potential $V(\phi)$
expression. The $V(\phi)$ independence makes the FE solving and computations
easier. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications
in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom
models of physical processes.

**Abstract**: Lower-Limb Fractures (LLF) are a major health concern for older adults, often
leading to reduced mobility and prolonged recovery, potentially impairing daily
activities and independence. During recovery, older adults frequently face
social isolation and functional decline, complicating rehabilitation and
adversely affecting physical and mental health. Multi-modal sensor platforms
that continuously collect data and analyze it using machine-learning algorithms
can remotely monitor this population and infer health outcomes. They can also
alert clinicians to individuals at risk of isolation and decline. This paper
presents a new publicly available multi-modal sensor dataset, MAISON-LLF,
collected from older adults recovering from LLF in community settings. The
dataset includes data from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, motion detectors,
sleep-tracking mattresses, and clinical questionnaires on isolation and
decline. The dataset was collected from ten older adults living alone at home
for eight weeks each, totaling 560 days of 24-hour sensor data. For technical
validation, supervised machine-learning and deep-learning models were developed
using the sensor and clinical questionnaire data, providing a foundational
comparison for the research community.


### Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters

**PDF Url**: [2501.13885v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13885v1)

**Abstract**: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction,
simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many
applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is
actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters
of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same
task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible,
reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the
evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing
reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a
Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is
attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and
non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on
prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum
trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.


### Can effective descriptions of bosonic systems be considered complete?

**Abstract**: Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong-Ou-Mandel
effect to Bose-Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental
science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on
effective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their
infinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple
class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are
used to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural
bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum
effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional
spaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic
systems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to
capture real effects?
  Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum
technologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective
descriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our
technical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic
unitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary
evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can
be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical
operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications
for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide
universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they
show that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum
computing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional
Solovay--Kitaev theorem.


### Dark Photon Polarimetry

**Abstract**: We propose detecting dark photon (DP), a major candidate for wave dark
matter, through polarimetry. The DP can modify Maxwell's equations, due to its
kinetic mixing with regular photon, inducing an oscillating component in the
electromagnetic field. This may leave an imprint in polarimetric light signals,
characterised by a distinctive wave pattern in spacetime. As a demonstration,
we apply this methodology to investigate ultralight DP produced through the
superradiance of supermassive black holes. Then using the polarimetric
measurements of the radiation from M87$^\ast$ at the Event Horizon Telescope,
we show that all Stokes parameters can serve as a probe in conducting this
task. Especially, the absence of significant temporal variation in the
linear-polarisation position angle of the M87$^\ast$ images allows us to set
novel limits on the photon-DP mixing parameter over the rarely-explored DP mass
range of $10^{-22}$--$10^{-20}$eV, with the best reach of $\sim 10^{-8}$
achieved at $\sim 10^{-20.2}$eV. Given the universality of its underlying
physics, we expect the DP polarimetry to be broadly applied for the DP
detection in laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.

**Abstract**: The search for a space-time variation of the fundamental constants has been
explored over the years to test our physical theories. In this paper, we use
the dispersion measure ($DM$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) combined with type Ia
supernovae (SNe) data to investigate a possible redshift evolution of the
fine-structure constant ($\alpha$), considering the runaway dilaton scenario,
which predicts $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} = - \gamma\ln{(1+z)}$, where
$\gamma$ is a constant proportional to the current value of the coupling
between the dilaton field and hadronic matter. We derive all the relevant
expressions for the $DM$ dependence concerning the fine-structure constant and
constrain the parameter $\gamma$ from measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs
and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We also use Monte Carlo
simulations to forecast the constraining power of larger samples of FRB
measurements for data sets with $N = 500$ and $N = 1000$ points. We found that
the uncertainty on $\gamma$ can be improved by one order of magnitude and that
limits on $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha}$ beyond $\sigma \sim 10^{-2}$ will
depend crucially on better control of statistical and systematic uncertainties
of upcoming FRB data.


### The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$
**Authors**: Lorenzo Iorio

**PDF Url**: [2411.08686v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08686v4)

**Abstract**: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial
configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured
exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due
to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is
described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital
precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object,
calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully
reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In
particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of
the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular
orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring
precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm
0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically
meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the
effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii.
Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the
angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the
years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of
$1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the
amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the
aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.


### Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra

**Abstract**: The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints
in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational
influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one
second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe.
This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique
signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these
relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of
particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to
robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and
polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these
spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase
shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying
these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at
about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with
additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole
Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model
prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the
capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise
phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the
$1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally,
we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos
and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues
for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and
model-agnostic way.

**Abstract**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large
models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open
question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing
image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive
investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image
generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for
verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results
demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to
significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the
pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential
Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image
generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential
assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and
PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated
unsatisfactory image. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a
baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24%
improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We
hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating
CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation. Code and models are

### Truncated Consistency Models
**Authors**: Sangyun Lee, Yilun Xu, Tomas Geffner, Giulia Fanti, Karsten Kreis, Arash Vahdat, Weili Nie

**Published Date**: 2024-10-18

**Abstract**: Consistency models have recently been introduced to accelerate sampling from
diffusion models by directly predicting the solution (i.e., data) of the
probability flow ODE (PF ODE) from initial noise. However, the training of
consistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF
ODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more
challenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only
concerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this
training paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency
models. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the
truncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at
earlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new
parameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure
that prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial
solution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times64$ datasets show that
our method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art
consistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\times$ smaller
networks. Project page: https://truncated-cm.github.io/


### Improving Video Generation with Human Feedback

**Abstract**: Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow
techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and
prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses
human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation
model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference
dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise
annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a
multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various
design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement
learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we
introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those
from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct
preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for
flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies
reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that
VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO
demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard
supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom
weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video
quality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.


### Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction
**Authors**: Zhi Sheng, Yuan Yuan, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li

**PDF Url**: [2501.13794v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13794v1)

**Abstract**: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from
cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and
supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile
traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both
regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing
such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent
uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising
networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially
leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our
analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions,
exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework
that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components,
with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's
ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly
integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering
predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over
30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.

**Abstract**: Time series analysis has become crucial in various fields, from engineering
and finance to healthcare and social sciences. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive review and evaluation of time series embedding methods for
effective representations in machine learning and deep learning models. We
introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their
theoretical foundations and application contexts. Unlike previous surveys, our
work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each
category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks
across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the
dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of
careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific
applications, including engineering systems. To facilitate further research and
practical applications, we provide an open-source code repository implementing
these embedding methods. This study contributes to the field by offering a
systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding
practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications,
and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.
