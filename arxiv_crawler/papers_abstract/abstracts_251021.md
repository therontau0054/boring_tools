**Abstract**: General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared
regime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics
generically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary.
One route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion,
non-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard
(ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing
Gravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations
such as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16
and PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful
theory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are
also phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the
combined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in
the vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the
leading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory
as $m\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes.
By contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential
and GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\alpha_1$ and
$\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations
put mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For
example, if we assume $\alpha_1\simeq\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain
$\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 4.2\times 10^{83}$ for $m\sim 3\times
10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 1.3\times 10^{75}$ for $m\sim
10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first
astrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order
gravity.

**PDF Url**: [2510.17782v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17782v1)

**Abstract**: The top quark plays an important role in a number of new physics models, some
of which introduce violations to some of the accidental symmetries of the SM,
such as the lepton number conservation or introduce additional sources of
others already broken, such as the CP symmetry. A set of measurements is
presented that probe violation of these symmetries in processes involving the
top quark, in association with additional particles.

**Abstract**: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied
extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different
scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools,
the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to
thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental
difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and
the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe
physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out
numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic
lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity
physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this
model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find
that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated
thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the
non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body
interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find
that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in
the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with
reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.


### Prediction of Sea Ice Velocity and Concentration in the Arctic Ocean using Physics-informed Neural Network
**Authors**: Younghyun Koo, Maryam Rahnemoonfar

**Published Date**: 2025-10-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-10-20

**PDF Url**: [2510.17756v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17756v1)

**Abstract**: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

**Abstract**: The current Timing System at Fermilab has been around for 40 years and
currently relies on 7 CAMAC crates and over 100 CAMAC cards to produce the
Tevatron Clock (TCLK). Thanks to the ingenuity of those before us, this has
allowed Fermilab the flexibility to change the timing and Events for its
accelerator as beamlines and projects have changed over the years. With the
advent of the Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II), the Timing System at
Fermilab is being reimagined into a single chassis with even greater
flexibility and functionality for decades to come while tackling the
ever-challenging task of maintaining backwards compatibility.

**Abstract**: A referential example of a physical system that supports bound states in the
continuum (BICs) with an infinite quality factor ($Q$-factor) is a
subwavelength lattice of discrete scatterers (resonators) whose response can be
significantly modified by exploiting lattice interactions. In this work, we
explore the interference Friedrich-Wintgen mechanism for realizing acoustic
BICs (trapped modes) at the $\Gamma$-point (in-plane Bloch wave vector
$\mathbf{k}_{\parallel} = \mathbf{0}$) in biperiodic lattices of acoustic
resonators with one resonator per unit cell. To do so, we expand the pressure
field from the lattice into a series of scalar zonal ($m = 0$) spherical
multipoles, carried by a normally incident plane wave, and formulate analytical
conditions on the resonator's multipole moments under which an eigenmode
becomes a BIC. The conditions allow us to determine the lattice constant and
frequency values that enable the formation of the axisymmetric BIC due to the
destructive interference of radiation from zonal multipole moments of a certain
parity, although each moment radiates individually. By employing the T-matrix
method for acoustic metasurfaces, we numerically investigate the BIC resonance
in various structures, including finite arrays, and also the transformation of
such resonances into high-$Q$ quasi-BIC regimes, which can be excited by a
plane wave at normal incidence.

**Abstract**: Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to
relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The
cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments,
with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at
the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter
due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the
monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting
recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein,
to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying
our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger
Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array
Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the
flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the
role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the
possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic
fields.


### B-Meson Anomalies: Effective Field Theory Meets Machine Learning
**Authors**: Alejandro Mir, Jorge Alda, Siannah Penaranda

**Published Date**: 2025-10-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-10-20

**PDF Url**: [2510.17742v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17742v1)

**Abstract**: Discrepancies between experimental measurements and Standard Model
predictions in $B$-meson decays, especially in lepton flavor universality
ratios like $R_{D^{(*)}}$, $R_{J/\psi}$ and branching ratios for processes like
$B\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$, suggest possible new physics (NP). In this study, we use
an effective field theory framework, assuming NP effects only affect a single
generation in the interaction basis, leading to non-universal mixing when
rotating to the mass basis. We perform a global fit to the current experimental
data, exploring three scenarios characterized by different mixing patterns and
constraints. Our analysis finds that the best fit involves mixing between the
second and third quark generations, with no lepton sector mixing and
independent coefficients for singlet and triplet four-fermion operators. To
accurately capture the non-Gaussian nature of the resulting parameter
distributions, we use a Machine Learning-based Monte Carlo algorithm, enabling
the generation of representative samples that reflect the true underlying
distributions. This work highlights the valuable role of Machine Learning in
accurately modeling complex parameter distributions in particle physics
analyses.


### Automated computation of spin-density matrices and quantum observables for collider physics
**Authors**: Valentin Durupt, Fabio Maltoni, Olivier Mattelaer

**Published Date**: 2025-10-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-10-20

**PDF Url**: [2510.17730v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17730v1)

**Abstract**: We present a fully automated framework to compute production spin-density
matrices for generic collider processes at tree level within
\textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}. The method assembles helicity amplitudes into
event-by-event production matrices. These are written to the LHE file in a
compact form, together with run metadata, enabling direct post-processing of
quantum observables. The implementation supports bi- and multipartite qubit and
qutrit final states, configurable reference frames, and both polarised and
unpolarised initial states. A companion, easy-to-extend library provides
analysis routines to determine key quantum-information measures and witnesses.
These include purity, concurrence, and entanglement of formation for qubits;
Peres--Horodecki tests and negativity; spin-polarisation vectors and
correlation matrices; $D$-coefficients; and stabiliser-based ``magic''
measures. As a result, multi-particle quantum correlations can be quantified
systematically. We validate the implementation against known results for $t\bar
t$ and $VV$ ($V=W^\pm,Z$) production in $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions and in
heavy-resonance decays. We then consider new applications and study quantum
correlations in several LHC final states: $t\bar t W^\pm$, $tW^-$ vs.\ $t(\bar
t\to W^- \bar b)$, and $t\bar t t$ vs. $t\bar t t\bar t$.

**Abstract**: Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle
physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled
quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal
variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance
scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to
noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations,
control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a
two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal
estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust
against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities
approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation
strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode
squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via
collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$
improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols
remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable
quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.


## Diffusion
### Inference-Time Compute Scaling For Flow Matching

**Abstract**: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.


### VERA-V: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Qilin Liao, Anamika Lochab, Ruqi Zhang

**Published Date**: 2025-10-20

**Updated Date**: 2025-10-20

**PDF Url**: [2510.17759v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17759v1)

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual
reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored
vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on
brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow
subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a
variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as
learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This
probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial
inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to
approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks
and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further
integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts
that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces
adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM
attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and
frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the
best baseline on GPT-4o.


### GAS: Improving Discretization of Diffusion ODEs via Generalized Adversarial Solver

**Abstract**: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

**Abstract**: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, deep transformer models
often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations
converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks.
In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics
induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete
graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a
consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics.
Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which
consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We
also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to
preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby
extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed
techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results
consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with
minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.


### GUIDE: Enhancing Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning with Denoising Models
**Authors**: Vincenzo Carletti, Pasquale Foggia, Carlo Mazzocca, Giuseppe Parrella, Mario Vento

**Published Date**: 2025-10-20

**PDF Url**: [2510.17621v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17621v1)

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Machine Learning
(ML) models across multiple clients while preserving their privacy. Rather than
sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train
the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy
guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy
leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the
training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion
Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to
reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using
optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually
reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be
enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update
Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion
models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE
can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely
adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets.
Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe-
art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple
metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity,
as measured by the DreamSim metric.

**PDF Url**: [2510.15769v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15769v1)

**Abstract**: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of
artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and
finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study
investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,
web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of
explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive
counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity
enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings
contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered
explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on
user perception
