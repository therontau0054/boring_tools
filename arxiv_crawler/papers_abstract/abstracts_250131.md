**Abstract**: We present progress on the calculation of scalar, vector, and tensor form
factors for the following meson decays: $B\rightarrow\pi$, $B_s\rightarrow K$,
$D\rightarrow\pi$ and $D_s\rightarrow K$. This calculation uses the MILC HISQ
gluon field ensembles with HISQ valence quarks. We generate ensembles of
correlator data with varying lattice spacings, some as small as 0.044 fm. Some
ensembles have a strange-to-light quark mass ratio of 5:1 and others use the
physical light quark mass. The fully-relativistic, heavy-HISQ approach is used
for the heavy quark, with simulation masses ranging from the charm to near the
bottom. This heavy-HISQ approach provides nearly full coverage of the kinematic
range.

**Abstract**: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as powerful tools for
integrating physics-based models with data by minimizing both data and physics
losses. However, this multi-objective optimization problem is notoriously
challenging, with some benchmark problems leading to unfeasible solutions. To
address these issues, various strategies have been proposed, including adaptive
weight adjustments in the loss function. In this work, we introduce clear
definitions of accuracy and robustness in the context of PINNs and propose a
novel training algorithm based on the Primal-Dual (PD) optimization framework.
Our approach enhances the robustness of PINNs while maintaining comparable
performance to existing weight-balancing methods. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the PD method consistently achieves reliable solutions across
all investigated cases and can be easily implemented, facilitating its
practical adoption. The code is available at

**Abstract**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are influential machine learning
models that have gained prominence across various research fields, including
high-energy physics (HEP) simulations. Among them, Conditional GANs (CGANs)
offer a unique advantage by conditioning on specific parameters, making them
particularly well-suited for meson studies. Given the limited size of the
available meson dataset$ - $based on the quark content, quantum numbers, mass,
and width$ - $this study, for the first time, applies the CGAN framework to
augment the dataset of mesons, while preserving the inherent characteristics of
the original data. Using this enhanced dataset, we employ the CGAN model to
estimate the mass and width of both ordinary and exotic mesons, based solely on
their quark content and quantum numbers. Our CGAN$ - $based predictions
highlight the framework's potential as a reliable tool for meson property
estimation, providing valuable insights for future research in particle
physics.

**Abstract**: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising
applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on
strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum
chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of
matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are
challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum
simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on
reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on
Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are
encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently
using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution
through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with
atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection.
Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently
prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the
non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further
explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and
directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong
interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice.
These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic
systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.

**Abstract**: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a key process for
probing Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) properties.
Following its first detection by the COHERENT collaboration, recent
reactor-based experiments provide a unique opportunity to refine our current
understanding. In particular, the high-precision data from CONUS+, combined
with the strong bounds from TEXONO, not only validate the CE$\nu$NS process at
low energies but also provide improved constraints on the weak mixing angle,
neutrino electromagnetic properties - including charge radius, millicharge, and
magnetic moment - as well as non-standard interactions and light mediators. We
also examine the role of elastic neutrino-electron scattering, which gains
significance in certain BSM scenarios and allows us to obtain the best limit
for the millicharge of the electron neutrinos. By combining reactor and
higher-energy spallation neutron source measurements, this work strengthens
CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool for testing the Standard Model and beyond.

**Abstract**: The sensitivity of electron EDM experiments has been increasing at a rapid
pace, and could yield indications of new physics in the coming decade. An
intriguing possibility is that an EDM signal could be generated by new,
electroweak-charged particles at the TeV scale that couple to the Higgs and
contribute to the electron EDM at two-loop order via Barr-Zee diagrams. A
high-energy muon collider could decisively search for new physics at this
scale. In this work, we explore this complementarity between colliders and EDM
experiments, and note that Barr-Zee diagrams from the aforementioned particles
are closely related to vector-boson scattering processes at a muon collider.
These loop corrections lead to kinematic features in the differential cross
sections of these processes, dictated by the optical theorem. We demonstrate
this connection in the context of the singlet-doublet and doublet-triplet
extensions to the SM, explore the detectability of these features at a muon
collider experiment, and discuss how these measurements can be used to
ascertain the underlying model parameters.


### Mitigating shot noise in local overlapping quantum tomography with semidefinite programming

**Abstract**: Reduced density matrices (RDMs) are fundamental in quantum information
processing, allowing the computation of local observables, such as energy and
correlation functions, without the exponential complexity of fully
characterizing quantum states. In the context of near-term quantum computing,
RDMs provide sufficient information to effectively design variational quantum
algorithms. However, their experimental estimation is challenging, as it
involves preparing and measuring quantum states in multiple bases - a
resource-intensive process susceptible to producing non-physical RDMs due to
shot noise from limited measurements. To address this, we propose a method to
mitigate shot noise by re-enforcing certain physicality constraints on RDMs.
While verifying RDM compatibility with a global state is QMA-complete, we relax
this condition by enforcing compatibility constraints up to a certain level
using a polynomial-size semidefinite program to reconstruct overlapping RDMs
from simulated experimental data. Our approach yields, on average, tighter
bounds for the same number of measurements compared to tomography without
compatibility constraints. We demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our
method by integrating it into an algorithmic cooling procedure to prepare
low-energy states of local Hamiltonians. Simulations on frustrated Hamiltonians
reveal notable improvements in accuracy and resource efficiency, highlighting
the potential of our approach for practical applications in near-term quantum
computing.

**PDF Url**: [2501.18518v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18518v1)

**Abstract**: This paper gives a concise but rigorous mathematical description of a
material control volume that is separated into two parts by a singular surface
at which physical states are discontinuous. The geometrical background material
is summarized in a unified manner. Transport theorems for use in generic
balance laws are given with proofs since they provide some insight into the
results. Also the step from integral balances to differential equations is
given in some detail.


### Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons
**Authors**: Erica Bertolini, Giandomenico Palumbo

**Published Date**: 2025-01-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-30

**PDF Url**: [2501.18510v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18510v1)

**Abstract**: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel
paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep
connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial
generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework
with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes
electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with
reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we
find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case,
precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.


### L-shell Photoionisation Cross Sections in the S^{+}, S^{2+}, S^{3+} Isonuclear Sequence
**Authors**: J. -P. Mosnier, E. T. Kennedy, D. Cubaynes, J. -M. Bizau, S. Guilbaud, C. Blancard, B. M. McLaughlin, M. F. Hasoglu, T. W. Gorczyca

**PDF Url**: [2501.18497v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18497v1)

**Abstract**: We present absolute L-shell photoionisation cross sections for the S+, S2+,
S3+ions. The cross sections were obtained using the monochromatised photon beam
delivered by the SOLEIL synchrotron source coupled with an ion beam extracted
from an electron cyclotron resonance source (ECRIS) in the merged dual-beam
configuration. The cross sections for single, double and triple ionisation were
measured and combined to generate total photoionisation cross sections. For
each of the S+, S2+, S3+ ions, the photon energy regions corresponding to the
excitation and ionisation of a 2p or a 2s electron (175-230 eV) were
investigated. The experimental results are interpreted with the help of
multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock (MCDF) and Breit-Pauli R-Matrix (BPRM) or Dirac
R-Matrix (DARC) theoretical calculations. The former generates photoabsorption
cross sections from eigenenergies and eigenfunctions obtained by solving
variationally the multiconfiguration Dirac Hamiltonian while the latter
calculate cross sections for photon scattering by atoms. The cross sectional
spectra feature rich resonance structures with narrow natural widths (typically
less than 100 meV) due to 2p to nd excitations below and up to the 2p
thresholds. This behaviour is consistent with the large number of inner-shell
states based on correlation and spin-orbit mixed configurations having three
open subshells. Strong and wide (typically 1 eV) Rydberg series of resonances
due to 2s to np excitations dominate above the 2p threshold.


## Diffusion
### Diffusion Autoencoders are Scalable Image Tokenizers

**Abstract**: Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in
learning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a
simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations
for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning
objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image
tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our
insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current
state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of
heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on
non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We
show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to
scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show
that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the
current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves
competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and
downstream image generation tasks.


### More Expressive Attention with Negative Weights
**Authors**: Ang Lv, Ruobing Xie, Shuaipeng Li, Jiayi Liao, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Di Wang, Rui Yan

**Published Date**: 2024-11-11

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-30

**PDF Url**: [2411.07176v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07176v3)

**Abstract**: We propose a novel attention mechanism, named Cog Attention, that enables
attention weights to be negative for enhanced expressiveness, which stems from
two key factors: (1) Cog Attention enhances parameter flexibility. For example,
unlike traditional softmax attention heads that use a static output-value (OV)
matrix to delete or copy inputs that the heads attend to, Cog Attention
naturally learns to use the sign of dynamic query-key (QK) inner products to
represent these operations. This enables Cog Attention to perform multiple
operations simultaneously within a single head. Meanwhile, Cog Attention's OV
matrix can focus more on refinement or modification. (2) Cog Attention enhances
the model's robustness against representational collapse by preventing the
``over-squashing'' of earlier tokens into later positions. We develop
Transformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including
decoder-only models at various scales for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion
models for image generation. Experiments show that models using Cog Attention
exhibit superior performance compared to those employing traditional softmax
attention modules. Our approach suggests a promising research direction for
rethinking and breaking the entrenched constraints of traditional softmax
attention, such as the requirement for non-negative weights.


### Beyond Prior Limits: Addressing Distribution Misalignment in Particle Filtering
**Authors**: Yiwei Shi, Jingyu Hu, Yu Zhang, Mengyue Yang, Weinan Zhang, Cunjia Liu, Weiru Liu

**Published Date**: 2025-01-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-01-30

**PDF Url**: [2501.18501v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18501v1)

**Abstract**: Particle filtering is a Bayesian inference method and a fundamental tool in
state estimation for dynamic systems, but its effectiveness is often limited by
the constraints of the initial prior distribution, a phenomenon we define as
the Prior Boundary Phenomenon. This challenge arises when target states lie
outside the prior's support, rendering traditional particle filtering methods
inadequate for accurate estimation. Although techniques like unbounded priors
and larger particle sets have been proposed, they remain computationally
prohibitive and lack adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To systematically
overcome these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Enhanced Particle
Filtering Framework, which introduces three key innovations: adaptive diffusion
through exploratory particles, entropy-driven regularisation to prevent weight
collapse, and kernel-based perturbations for dynamic support expansion. These
mechanisms collectively enable particle filtering to explore beyond prior
boundaries, ensuring robust state estimation for out-of-boundary targets.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate framework's
effectiveness, indicating significant improvements in success rates and
estimation accuracy across high-dimensional and non-convex scenarios.


### Zero-Shot Medical Phrase Grounding with Off-the-shelf Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Localizing the exact pathological regions in a given medical scan is an
important imaging problem that traditionally requires a large amount of
bounding box ground truth annotations to be accurately solved. However, there
exist alternative, potentially weaker, forms of supervision, such as
accompanying free-text reports, which are readily available. The task of
performing localization with textual guidance is commonly referred to as phrase
grounding. In this work, we use a publicly available Foundation Model, namely
the Latent Diffusion Model, to perform this challenging task. This choice is
supported by the fact that the Latent Diffusion Model, despite being generative
in nature, contains cross-attention mechanisms that implicitly align visual and
textual features, thus leading to intermediate representations that are
suitable for the task at hand. In addition, we aim to perform this task in a
zero-shot manner, i.e., without any training on the target task, meaning that
the model's weights remain frozen. To this end, we devise strategies to select
features and also refine them via post-processing without extra learnable
parameters. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art approaches
which explicitly enforce image-text alignment in a joint embedding space via
contrastive learning. Results on a popular chest X-ray benchmark indicate that
our method is competitive with SOTA on different types of pathology, and even
outperforms them on average in terms of two metrics (mean IoU and AUC-ROC).

**PDF Url**: [2412.11439v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11439v2)

**Abstract**: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space,
namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for ${de~novo}$ drug
design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for
example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed
to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper,
we show that Bayesian flow network is capable of effortlessly generating high
quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. We introduce a
semi-autoregressive training/sampling method that helps to enhance the model
performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models.
