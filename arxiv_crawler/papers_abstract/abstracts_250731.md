**Abstract**: Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching
applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of
quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding
of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,
nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress
is the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible
magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational
interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this
work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property
testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable
magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state
becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate
governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available
copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state
$k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we
establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state
from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.
These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes
the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby
offering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a
quantum resource.

**Abstract**: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in
the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed
where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in
conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so
far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate
the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and
the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions.
Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to
obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both
generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler
class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two
dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the
possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We
establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns
according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant,
highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by
building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical
consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice
Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically
confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss
possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to
study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap
topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher
dimensions.

**Abstract**: We study the flavor-changing neutral current contributions to the trilinear
neutral gauge boson couplings $Z\gamma V^\ast$ ($V=Z$, $\gamma$) at the
one-loop level. Only the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_3^Z$ is induced, with
the relevant contributions arising from top quark couplings. To our numerical
analysis, constraints on the $Z\overline{t}q$ ($q=c$, $u$) couplings are
obtained from current LHC data, leading to bounds of
$|g_{\text{V}}^{tu}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tu}|\leqslant 0.007$ and
$|g_{\text{V}}^{tc}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tc}|\leqslant 0.0095$ for the vector
and axial couplings. The new contributions to the $h_3^Z$ form factor are of
order $10^{-7}$. Furthermore, we analyze the polarized partial decay widths of
the $V^\ast\rightarrow Z\gamma$ process, and a new type of left-right asymmetry
is also discussed. We find that in the presence of new physics, the polarized
$\Gamma(V^\ast\rightarrow Z\gamma)$ exhibits significant deviations from the SM
prediction, resulting in a non-zero asymmetry.


### Demonstration of the rotational viscosity transfer across scales in Navier-Stokes turbulence
**Authors**: Satori Tsuzuki

**Abstract**: Mechanical effects that span multiple physical scales -- such as the
influence of vanishing molecular viscosity on large-scale flow structures under
specific conditions -- play a critical role in real fluid systems. The spin
angular momentum-conserving Navier--Stokes equations offer a theoretical
framework for describing such multiscale fluid dynamics by decomposing total
angular momentum into bulk and intrinsic spin components. However, this
framework still assumes locally non-solid rotational flows, a condition that
remains empirically unverified. This study addresses such unvalidated
assumptions intrinsic to the model and extends it within the framework of
turbulence hierarchy theory. The theory suggests that under certain conditions,
small-scale structures may transfer to larger scales through the rotational
viscosity. To verify this, we conducted spectral analyses of freely decaying
two-dimensional turbulence initialized with a vortex-concentrated distribution.
The results indicate that rotational viscosity exhibits interscale transfer
behavior, revealing a new mechanism by which order can propagate from small to
large scales in Navier--Stokes turbulence.

**Abstract**: Collisions play an important role in turbulence and transport of fusion
plasmas. For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain
of interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can
become overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to
high computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have
implemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use
in the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll
framework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time
integrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time
step in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure
conservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme
to correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian
distribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further
generalized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction
routine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and
conservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more
computationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has
been utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables
2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56
times faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because
the BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is
required by the LBD operator. Additionally, in this more collisional limit, we
demonstrate that the results of our simulations utilizing the implicit BGK
operator agreed well with simulations utilizing the more computationally
expensive LBD operator.

**Abstract**: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the
gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and
semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects)
exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger
waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the
detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features
following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect
signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black
holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform
templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In
this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory
arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose
scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features
is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real
interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio
of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is
estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to
the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel
distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement
data.

**Abstract**: Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional
properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their
vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a
high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation
of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular
dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration
pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a
defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of
kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte
Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through
applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing
simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors
driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's
ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or
machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations
and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.

**Abstract**: The total cross section for Compton scattering off atomic electrons,
$\gamma+e\rightarrow\gamma'+e'$, was measured using photons with energies
between 6.5 and 11.1 GeV incident on a $^9$Be target as part of the PrimEx-eta
experiment in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. This is the first measurement of this
fundamental QED process within this energy range. The total uncertainties of
the cross section, combining the statistical and systematic components in
quadrature, averaged to 3.4% across all energy bins. This not only demonstrates
the capability of this experimental setup to perform precision cross-section
measurements at forward angles but also allows us to compare with
state-of-the-art QED calculations.


### Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks
**Authors**: F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone

**Published Date**: 2025-07-30

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2507.22787v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22787v1)

**Abstract**: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model
inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are
replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$.
The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix
through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian
matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits
quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials:
energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random
configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations
encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and
order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N
\cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a
fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$)
and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between
associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in
systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the
scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim
(Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which
closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D
central-force spring networks.

**Abstract**: We propose a physical system consisting of two optical cavities and a
two-level system (TLS), which can be viewed as a double single-sided cavity
system. The two cavities are crossed each other in a mutually perpendicular way
and are both single-sided. The TLS is coupled to the two cavities. The
universal input-output relation of the system, the reflection and transmission
coefficients are derived by exploiting the probability amplitude method. Then
by using the nitrogen-vacancy center instead of the TLS, we generate the
controlled-phase gate and the controlled-controlled-phase gate on the photon
qubits, with simple protocols that can be accomplished in both weak and strong
coupling regimes. The protocols are shown to give rise to high fidelities and
gate efficiencies.

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.


### The Effect of Stochasticity in Score-Based Diffusion Sampling: a KL Divergence Analysis
**Authors**: Bernardo P. Schaeffer, Ricardo M. S. Rosa, Glauco Valle

**Published Date**: 2025-06-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2506.11378v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11378v2)

**Abstract**: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) parameterized by an
arbitrary time-dependent stochasticity parameter or a probability flow ODE,
corresponding to the stochasticity parameter set to zero. In this work, we
study the effect of this stochasticity on the generation process through bounds
on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, complementing the analysis with
numerical and analytical examples. Our main results apply to linear forward
SDEs with additive noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify
how errors from the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under
different choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are
derived using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward
process, which enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along
sampling. For exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an
error-correcting mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling
trajectory. For an approximate score function, there is a trade-off between
error correction and score error amplification, so that stochasticity can
either improve or worsen the performance, depending on the structure of the
score error. Numerical experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical
example are included to illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.


### Ultra3D: Efficient and High-Fidelity 3D Generation with Part Attention
**Authors**: Yiwen Chen, Zhihao Li, Yikai Wang, Hu Zhang, Qin Li, Chi Zhang, Guosheng Lin

**PDF Url**: [2507.17745v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17745v2)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.


### Inferring biological processes with intrinsic noise from cross-sectional data

**PDF Url**: [2410.07501v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07501v2)

**Abstract**: Inferring dynamical models from data continues to be a significant challenge
in computational biology, especially given the stochastic nature of many
biological processes. We explore a common scenario in omics, where
statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time
points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that
generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore
noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of
optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space
probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as
the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference
(PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the
algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique
solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications,
we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in
high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of
cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.


### Equivariant Flow Matching for Point Cloud Assembly

**PDF Url**: [2505.21539v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21539v2)

**Abstract**: The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by
aligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant
solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically
show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to
learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly
model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector
fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant
path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process.
Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical
datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input
pieces are non-overlapped.
