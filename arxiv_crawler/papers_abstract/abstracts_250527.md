**Abstract**: Despite recent progress in general purpose robotics, robot policies still lag
far behind basic human capabilities in the real world. Humans interact
constantly with the physical world, yet this rich data resource remains largely
untapped in robot learning. We propose EgoZero, a minimal system that learns
robust manipulation policies from human demonstrations captured with Project
Aria smart glasses, $\textbf{and zero robot data}$. EgoZero enables: (1)
extraction of complete, robot-executable actions from in-the-wild, egocentric,
human demonstrations, (2) compression of human visual observations into
morphology-agnostic state representations, and (3) closed-loop policy learning
that generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy
EgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot
transfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of
data collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can
serve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way
toward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for
robots. Code and videos are available at https://egozero-robot.github.io.


### Entanglement Cost of Erasure Correction in Quantum MDS Codes

**Abstract**: In distributed quantum storage, physical qubits of a code will be stored
across the network. When qubits in one of the nodes are lost i.e. when the node
is erased, the remaining nodes need to communicate with a new node to replace
the lost qubits. Here, we look at the problem of how much entanglement cost is
needed to perform such a distributed quantum erasure correction. We focus on
distributed quantum storage based on quantum maximum distance separable (MDS)
codes. We derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost when the quantum network
used for the erasure correction has a star topology. We show that the simple
method of downloading the non-erased qudits and performing operations at a
single node is optimal when the minimal number of non-erased nodes are
accessed. It remains to be seen what the entanglement cost will be when a
non-minimal number of non-erased nodes are accessed. The techniques used in
this work can be developed further to study the entanglement cost of quantum
erasure correction in more general code families and network topologies.

**PDF Url**: [2504.16816v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16816v5)

**Abstract**: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum
motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning.
Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three
classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The
solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving
pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight is
the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of
angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit
other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are
given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency
analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their
unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires a
tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims
to discuss nonlinear pendulum.

**Abstract**: Lorentz-equivariant neural networks are becoming the leading architectures
for high-energy physics. Current implementations rely on specialized layers,
limiting architectural choices. We introduce Lorentz Local Canonicalization
(LLoCa), a general framework that renders any backbone network exactly
Lorentz-equivariant. Using equivariantly predicted local reference frames, we
construct LLoCa-transformers and graph networks. We adapt a recent approach to
geometric message passing to the non-compact Lorentz group, allowing
propagation of space-time tensorial features. Data augmentation emerges from
LLoCa as a special choice of reference frame. Our models surpass
state-of-the-art accuracy on relevant particle physics tasks, while being
$4\times$ faster and using $5$-$100\times$ fewer FLOPs.


### The Quantum Wave Function as a Complex Probability Distribution
**Authors**: Charalampos Antonakos

**Published Date**: 2025-02-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.10523v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10523v4)

**Abstract**: This paper suggests an interpretation for the wave function, based on some
elements of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, the time-symmetric laws of quantum
theory and complex probabilities. Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the
wave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex
probability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real
forward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two
quasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the
Born rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability
sets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for
explaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that
produces this so-called "wave-like" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective
also challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental
concept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of
quantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of
stochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the
appearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum
behavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a
probabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic
hidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight
into the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for
a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.


### Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of modulus
**Authors**: Teepanis Chachiyo

**Published Date**: 2025-05-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2505.17159v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17159v2)

**Abstract**: The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k),
appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is
no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here,
approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic
behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k)
and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic
limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and
0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals
with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy
of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and
architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced
physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader
collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example,
the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary
functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing
Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact
inverse.


### Hardware-tailored logical Clifford circuits for stabilizer codes

**Abstract**: Quantum error correction is the art of protecting fragile quantum information
through suitable encoding and active interventions. After encoding $k$ logical
qubits into $n>k$ physical qubits using a stabilizer code, this amounts to
measuring stabilizers, decoding syndromes, and applying an appropriate
correction. Although quantum information can be protected in this way, it is
notoriously difficult to manipulate encoded quantum data without introducing
uncorrectable errors. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for
constructing hardware-tailored quantum circuits that implement any desired
Clifford unitary on the logical level of any given stabilizer code. Our main
contribution is the formulation of this task as a discrete optimization
problem. We can explicitly integrate arbitrary hardware connectivity
constraints. As a key feature, our framework naturally incorporates an
optimization over all Clifford gauges (differing only in their action outside
the code space) of a desired logical circuit. In this way, we find, for
example, fault-tolerant and teleportation-free logical Hadamard circuits for
the $[[8,3,2]]$ code. From a broader perspective, we turn away from the
standard generator decomposition approach and instead focus on the holistic
compilation of entire logical circuits, leading to significant savings in
practice. Our work introduces both the necessary mathematics and open-source
software to compile hardware-tailored logical Clifford circuits for stabilizer
codes.


### Efficient Optimization Accelerator Framework for Multistate Ising Problems
**Authors**: Chirag Garg, Sayeef Salahuddin

**Published Date**: 2025-05-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2505.20250v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20250v1)

**Abstract**: Ising Machines are a prominent class of hardware architectures that aim to
solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These machines consist of a
network of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the
optimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are
transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to
harness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this
transformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more
complex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely
impacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin
interactions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce
the exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class
of multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to
illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology
achieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine
learning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing
Ising methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering
with our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50%
compared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a
1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up
to 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the
number of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising
machines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all
metrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution
quality. Thus, this work expands the potential of existing Ising hardware to
solve a broad class of these multistate optimization problems.


### A structure-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas
**Authors**: Kun Huang, Irene M. Gamba, Chi-Wang Shu

**Published Date**: 2025-05-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2505.20210v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20210v1)

**Abstract**: Particle-wave interaction is of fundamental interest in plasma physics,
especially in the study of runaway electrons in magnetic confinement fusion.
Analogous to the concept of photons and phonons, wave packets in plasma can
also be treated as quasi-particles, called plasmons. To model the ``mixture" of
electrons and plasmons in plasma, a set of ``collisional" kinetic equations has
been derived, based on weak turbulence limit and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
(WKB) approximation.
  There are two main challenges in solving the electron-plasmon kinetic system
numerically. Firstly, non-uniform plasma density and magnetic field results in
high dimensionality and the presence of multiple time scales. Secondly, a
physically reliable numerical solution requires a structure-preserving scheme
that enforces the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.
  In this paper, we propose a struture-preserving multiscale solver for
particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas. The solver
combines a conservative local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) scheme for the
interaction part with a trajectory averaging method for the plasmon Hamiltonian
flow part. Numerical examples for a non-uniform magnetized plasma in an
infinitely long symmetric cylinder are presented. It is verified that the LDG
scheme rigorously preserves all the conservation laws, and the trajectory
averaging method significantly reduces the computational cost.

**Authors**: Fabian Lange, Johann Usovitsch, Zihao Wu

**Published Date**: 2025-05-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2505.20197v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20197v1)

**Abstract**: We present version 3 of Kira, a Feynman integral reduction program for
high-precision calculations in quantum field theory and gravitational-wave
physics. Building on previous versions, Kira 3 introduces optimized seeding and
equation selection algorithms, significantly improving performance for
multi-loop and multi-scale problems. New features include convenient numerical
sampling, symbolic integration-by-parts reductions, and support for
user-defined additional relations. We demonstrate its capabilities through
benchmarks on two- and three-loop topologies, showcasing up to two orders of
magnitude improvement over Kira 2.3. Kira 3 is publicly available and poised to
support ambitious projects in particle physics and beyond.


## Diffusion
### In-Context Brush: Zero-shot Customized Subject Insertion with Context-Aware Latent Space Manipulation
**Authors**: Yu Xu, Fan Tang, You Wu, Lin Gao, Oliver Deussen, Hongbin Yan, Jintao Li, Juan Cao, Tong-Yee Lee

**Published Date**: 2025-05-26

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2505.20271v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20271v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual
generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes"
user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However,
existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high
fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In
this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized
subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context
learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the
textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the
masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the
subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a
pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via
dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting"
within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect
the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across
different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential
attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and
image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring
dedicated training or additional data collection.


### SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems
**Authors**: Ismail Alkhouri, Shijun Liang, Cheng-Han Huang, Jimmy Dai, Qing Qu, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Rongrong Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-10-06

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2410.04479v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04479v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling
from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving
inverse problems, the reverse sampling steps are modified to approximately
sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution. However, these
modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of
measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct
errors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization
and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions
for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these
conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only
enforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion
consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed
step-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains
a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at
every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly),
our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to
our method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to SOTA
baselines, our experiments across several linear and non-linear tasks (with
natural and medical images) demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or
superior results in terms of standard similarity metrics and run-time.


### Roll the dice & look before you leap: Going beyond the creative limits of next-token prediction
**Authors**: Vaishnavh Nagarajan, Chen Henry Wu, Charles Ding, Aditi Raghunathan

**Published Date**: 2025-04-21

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2504.15266v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15266v2)

**Abstract**: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction
of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably
quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like
real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our
tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a)
discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay,
drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in
designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and
conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively;
multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models,
comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to
elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at
the input layer (dubbed as seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as
(and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output
layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing
open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond
next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code
available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity


### UniMoMo: Unified Generative Modeling of 3D Molecules for De Novo Binder Design
**Authors**: Xiangzhe Kong, Zishen Zhang, Ziting Zhang, Rui Jiao, Jianzhu Ma, Wenbing Huang, Kai Liu, Yang Liu

**Published Date**: 2025-03-25

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2503.19300v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19300v3)

**Abstract**: The design of target-specific molecules such as small molecules, peptides,
and antibodies is vital for biological research and drug discovery. Existing
generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to
address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to
enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative
Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing
binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular,
UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks,
where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular
fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for
3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to
compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant
diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small
molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing
domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.


### InfoBridge: Mutual Information estimation via Bridge Matching
**Authors**: Sergei Kholkin, Ivan Butakov, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Gushchin, Alexander Korotin

**Published Date**: 2025-02-03

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-26

**PDF Url**: [2502.01383v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01383v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion bridge models have recently become a powerful tool in the field of
generative modeling. In this work, we leverage their power to address another
important problem in machine learning and information theory, the estimation of
the mutual information (MI) between two random variables. We show that by using
the theory of diffusion bridges, one can construct an unbiased estimator for
data posing difficulties for conventional MI estimators. We showcase the
performance of our estimator on two standard MI estimation benchmarks, i.e.,
low-dimensional and image-based, and on real-world data, i.e., protein language
model embeddings.


## Quantitative Finance
### A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations
**Authors**: Kristoffer Andersson, Alessandro Gnoatto, Camilo Andrés García Trillos

**Published Date**: 2025-05-23

**Updated Date**: 2025-05-23

**PDF Url**: [2505.18297v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18297v1)

**Abstract**: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra
integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants.
The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a
single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit
classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error
bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root
dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal
two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains
stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps
wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method
handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution.
These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional,
path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.
