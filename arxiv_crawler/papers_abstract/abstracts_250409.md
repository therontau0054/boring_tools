**Abstract**: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a
single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to
capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a
novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range
Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this
regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite -
effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization
from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms
as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics,
including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.

**Abstract**: Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers
to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and
science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large
language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics,
mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We
introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs
to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem
descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to
compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped
with the ability to interact with the software through its Application
Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its
solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates
executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with
and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would
push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability
would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers
and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex
problems in the real world. The code is available at

**Abstract**: A time-periodic drive enables the engineering of non-equilibrium quantum
systems by hybridizing Floquet sidebands. We investigated DC voltage-biased
planar Josephson junctions built upon epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures in
which the intrinsic AC Josephson effect is theoretically expected to provide a
time-periodic drive leading to Floquet hybridization. Tunneling spectroscopy is
performed using probes positioned at the ends of the junction to study the
evolution of the local density of states. With applied drive, we observe
multiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and
in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise
from a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the
superconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our
numerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width
to coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization.
This work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing
voltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and
provides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet
effects.


### Renormalization Group in far-from-equilibrium states
**Authors**: Vladimir Rosenhaus, Michael Smolkin

**PDF Url**: [2504.06243v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06243v1)

**Abstract**: We study renormalization group flows in far-from-equilibrium states. The
study is made tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous,
time-independent, and scale-invariant. Such states, in which mode $k$ has
occupation numbers $n_k \sim k^{-\gamma}$, are well known in nonlinear physics.
RG flow in such states is qualitatively different from that in the vacuum -- a
positive $\gamma$ decreases the dimension of an operator, turning marginal
interactions into relevant interactions. We compute one-loop beta functions.
Depending on the sign of the beta function, backreaction may either cause a
minor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature of the
state. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the
epsilon expansion and IR fixed points, with epsilon now set by the scaling of
the interaction rather than the spacetime dimension. In the language of RG
flow, critical-balance scaling -- which has applications in fields as varied as
astrophysics and ocean waves -- corresponds to the state dynamically adjusting
itself along the RG flow until the interaction becomes marginal.


### Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras
**Authors**: Haru-Tada Sato

**Published Date**: 2024-12-22

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2412.17030v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17030v3)

**Abstract**: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the
Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1)
quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By
examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we
establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical
realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case,
we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and
spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2
supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete
case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We
organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading,
revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems
while preserving essential algebraic properties.


### Phenomenology of the semileptonic $Σ_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, Σ_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\barν_{\ell}$ transition within QCD sum rules
**Authors**: L. Khajouei, K. Azizi

**Published Date**: 2024-10-14

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2410.11074v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11074v3)

**Abstract**: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$
semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay
$\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in
three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We
compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by
incorporating both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions of the
operator product expansion series up to a mass dimension six. Having acquired
the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are
determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information
can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the
possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.


### Nonlinear Drift Waves Beyond the Hasegawa-Mima Model
**Authors**: Hamid Saleem

**Published Date**: 2025-01-27

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2501.15873v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15873v2)

**Abstract**: A general nonlinear equation for drift waves is derived, incorporating both
the nonlinear electron density term (scalar nonlinearity) and the ion vorticity
term (vector nonlinearity). It is noted that the Hasegawa-Mima (HM) equation
(A. Hasegawa and K. Mima, The Physics of Fluids 21, 87 (1978)) includes only
the ion vorticity term, while it omits the nonlinear electron density term,
which is a dominant nonlinear effect. The general nonlinear equation reduces to
the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation (H. Saleem, Physics of Plasmas 31, 112102
(2024)) if the normalized electrostatic potential is assumed to depend only on
a single spatial coordinate along the direction of predominant wave
propagation, i.e., \( \Phi = \Phi(y) \). If the scalar nonlinearity is
artificially neglected and a two-dimensional dependence of the electrostatic
potential is assumed, \( \Phi = \Phi(x, y) \), the equation reduces to a
Hasegawa-Mima-like equation, which admits a solution in the form of dipolar
vortices. It is further pointed out that, in the presence of a Boltzmann
density distribution for electrons, the HM equation was derived using the
approximation \( \frac{\partial_t \tilde{n}_i}{n_{i0}} \simeq \partial_t \Phi
\), whereas the more accurate expression \( \frac{\partial_t
\tilde{n}_i}{n_{i0}} \simeq \partial_t \left( \Phi + \frac{1}{2} \Phi^2 \right)
\) should be used.


### Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature
**Authors**: Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke

**Published Date**: 2024-12-29

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2412.20454v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20454v2)

**Abstract**: The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for
nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite
temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear
viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the
temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a
generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar
and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the
Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power
in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic
potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and
shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$)
imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example,
these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the
cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless
combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy.
Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range
of applicability of the model.


### A score-based particle method for homogeneous Landau equation
**Authors**: Yan Huang, Li Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-05-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2405.05187v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05187v2)

**Abstract**: We propose a novel score-based particle method for solving the Landau
equation in plasmas, that seamlessly integrates learning with
structure-preserving particle methods [arXiv:1910.03080]. Building upon the
Lagrangian viewpoint of the Landau equation, a central challenge stems from the
nonlinear dependence of the velocity field on the density. Our primary
innovation lies in recognizing that this nonlinearity is in the form of the
score function, which can be approximated dynamically via techniques from
score-matching. The resulting method inherits the conservation properties of
the deterministic particle method while sidestepping the necessity for kernel
density estimation in [arXiv:1910.03080]. This streamlines computation and
enhances scalability with dimensionality. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
estimate by demonstrating that the KL divergence between our approximation and
the true solution can be effectively controlled by the score-matching loss.
Additionally, by adopting the flow map viewpoint, we derive an update formula
for exact density computation. Extensive examples have been provided to show
the efficiency of the method, including a physically relevant case of Coulomb
interaction.


### Resonant Excitation of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes
**Authors**: Hayato Motohashi

**Published Date**: 2024-07-21

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2407.15191v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15191v2)

**Abstract**: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes
(QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing
near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory
of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant
phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning
the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for
characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for
rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in
gravity.


## Diffusion
### TabRep: a Simple and Effective Continuous Representation for Training Tabular Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jacob Si, Zijing Ou, Mike Qu, Zhengrui Xiang, Yingzhen Li

**Published Date**: 2025-04-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2504.04798v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04798v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have been the predominant generative model for tabular data
generation. However, they face the conundrum of modeling under a separate
versus a unified data representation. The former encounters the challenge of
jointly modeling all multi-modal distributions of tabular data in one model.
While the latter alleviates this by learning a single representation for all
features, it currently leverages sparse suboptimal encoding heuristics and
necessitates additional computation costs. In this work, we address the latter
by presenting TabRep, a tabular diffusion architecture trained with a unified
continuous representation. To motivate the design of our representation, we
provide geometric insights into how the data manifold affects diffusion models.
The key attributes of our representation are composed of its density,
flexibility to provide ample separability for nominal features, and ability to
preserve intrinsic relationships. Ultimately, TabRep provides a simple yet
effective approach for training tabular diffusion models under a continuous
data manifold. Our results showcase that TabRep achieves superior performance
across a broad suite of evaluations. It is the first to synthesize tabular data
that exceeds the downstream quality of the original datasets while preserving
privacy and remaining computationally efficient.


### Physics-aware generative models for turbulent fluid flows through energy-consistent stochastic interpolants
**Authors**: Nikolaj T. Mücke, Benjamin Sanderse

**Published Date**: 2025-04-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2504.05852v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05852v1)

**Abstract**: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as
text, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of
generative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation,
where classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a
novel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which
enables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such
as energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic
generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our
approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic
interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark
turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and
stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional
diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable
results for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic
interpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative
models in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving
fundamental conservation properties.


### Mind the Trojan Horse: Image Prompt Adapter Enabling Scalable and Deceptive Jailbreaking
**Authors**: Junxi Chen, Junhao Dong, Xiaohua Xie

**Published Date**: 2025-04-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2504.05838v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05838v1)

**Abstract**: Recently, the Image Prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) has been increasingly
integrated into text-to-image diffusion models (T2I-DMs) to improve
controllability. However, in this paper, we reveal that T2I-DMs equipped with
the IP-Adapter (T2I-IP-DMs) enable a new jailbreak attack named the hijacking
attack. We demonstrate that, by uploading imperceptible image-space adversarial
examples (AEs), the adversary can hijack massive benign users to jailbreak an
Image Generation Service (IGS) driven by T2I-IP-DMs and mislead the public to
discredit the service provider. Worse still, the IP-Adapter's dependency on
open-source image encoders reduces the knowledge required to craft AEs.
Extensive experiments verify the technical feasibility of the hijacking attack.
In light of the revealed threat, we investigate several existing defenses and
explore combining the IP-Adapter with adversarially trained models to overcome
existing defenses' limitations. Our code is available at

### Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jiahao Chen, Yu Pan, Yi Du, Chunkai Wu, Lin Wang

**Published Date**: 2025-04-08

**Updated Date**: 2025-04-08

**PDF Url**: [2504.05815v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05815v1)

**Abstract**: Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the
most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images
by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that
diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to
enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate
their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on
target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor
attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks
often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image,
lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image
tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage
steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the
target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack.
"Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection
frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved
a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks.
In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different
hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at
