**Abstract**: While visuomotor policy learning has advanced robotic manipulation, precisely
executing contact-rich tasks remains challenging due to the limitations of
vision in reasoning about physical interactions. To address this, recent work
has sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning. However, many
existing approaches rely on optical tactile sensors that are either restricted
to recognition tasks or require complex dimensionality reduction steps for
policy learning. In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skin
sensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, and
inexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensors
effectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach that
uses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additional
tokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasks
involving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelf
retrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactile
sensing based policies. Further analysis reveals that combining tactile and
visual modalities enhances policy performance and spatial generalization,
achieving an average improvement of 27.5% across tasks.

**Abstract**: The ZX calculus is a graphical language for representing and rewriting
quantum circuits. While its graphical rewrite rules preserve semantics, they
may not preserve other features. For example, applying rewrites to a circuit
that implements an error-correcting code can change its distance. Here, we
define the notion of distance-preserving rewrites that enables the
transformation of error-correcting codes without changing their distance. Using
these rewrites, we propose an algorithm that transforms a high-weight Pauli
measurement into an equivalent quantum circuit with only single- and two-qubit
operations. Since we only use distance-preserving rewrites, we guarantee that
errors in the low-weight implementation do not propagate to create multiple
data errors. Going further, we generalise the Floquetification procedure of
[arXiv:2308.15489] to arbitrary stabiliser codes. Given a stabiliser code, we
synthesise a new quantum error-correcting code which encodes the same number of
qubits with at least the same distance. The number of additional qubits this
method requires is linearly dependent on the weight or the largest Pauli
measurement. This creates a tradeoff between easily implementable low-weight
Pauli measurements at the cost of additional physical qubits.

**Abstract**: In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of
synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker
Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our
understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron
radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to
explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under
which they emit radiation. The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure
both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the
near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of
relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal
that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher
intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration
of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with
theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our
understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.

**Abstract**: Simulating the dynamics of non-stationary, long-term many-body quantum
systems poses significant challenges due to the large size of the state space.
We are examining how traditional basis sets struggle to accurately represent
long-term dynamics when using incomplete sets. To address this issue, we
propose using an SU(2) coherent state basis and deriving equations of motion
for both time-independent and time-dependent Hamiltonian. This methodology
involves a sampling approach, where a subset of relevant configurations is
chosen based on energy criteria, and a projection method is used to enhance the
accuracy of wavefunction propagation while reducing computational cost. We
evaluate this method through numerical simulations of a seven-qubit system,
calculating key physical observables such as state probabilities and
domain-wall densities. Our results indicate that while complete basis sets
offer accurate dynamics, selected incomplete sets can recover essential
features, especially with the assistance of a projector. Our conclusion
suggests that the selected incomplete dual basis method can efficiently capture
both short-term and long-term dynamics.

**PDF Url**: [2410.17181v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17181v1)

**Abstract**: We derive a closed-form achievable rate for entanglement-assisted classical
communication over a lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, where the
entanglement is in the form of a Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum (TMSV) modulation
restricted to Phase Shift Keying (PSK). The achievable rate is non-asymptotic
in terms of the mean signal photon number, mean noise photon number, and
transmissivity defining the communication channel, which provides insights into
the interplay of these physical parameters and bridges recent experimental
demonstrations of entanglement-assisted communications with the coding theorems
used in information-theoretic proofs. The key challenge we address is deriving
an analytical bound for the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian mixed state
resulting from the phase modulation of one arm of a TMSV. Our approach hinges
on two key observations: 1) as the size of the PSK modulation increases, the
resulting mixed state converges in trace distance to a diagonal state in the
Fock basis; 2) the Fock-basis representation of the diagonal state involves
hypergeometric functions that can be appropriately bounded to offer a tractable
lower bound for the Holevo information.


### Evidence for a Lattice Supersolid of Subradiant Dipolar Excitons

**Abstract**: In condensed-matter physics, supersolids refer to many-body quantum states
breaking translational symmetry while exhibiting off-diagonal long-range order.
This combination is debated for commensurate crystals, however it is accessible
in lattice potentials fractionally filled by bosons with extended interactions.
Here, we report such lattice supersolid with dipolar excitons confined in a
sub-wavelength period potential. Excitons implement the Dicke-Hubbard
Hamiltonian controlled by spatially extended dipolar and Dicke correlations. At
half lattice-filling, these induce both a condensation in a single sub-radiant
state and a dipolar quantum order spontaneously breaking the lattice symmetry.
This combination signals a lattice supersolid dissipatively prepared across 8x8
sites. Our study underlines that nanoscopic exciton arrays open a route to
explore new frontiers of quantum matter, e.g. many-body entanglement, at the
interface with quantum nano-photonics.

**PDF Url**: [2410.17150v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17150v1)

**Abstract**: Using the Israel-Darmois junction conditions, we obtain a class of regular
dynamical interiors to the recently proposed black-bounce spacetimes which
regularises the Schwarzschild singularity by introducing a regularisation
parameter. We show that a regularised Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker like
interior geometry can not be matched smoothly with the exterior black-bounce
spacetime through a timelike hypersurface, as there always exists a thin shell
of non-zero energy-momentum tensor at the matching hypersurface. We obtain the
expressions for the energy density and pressure of the thin shell
energy-momentum tensor in terms of the regularisation parameter and derive an
evolution equation for the scale factor of the interior geometry by imposing
physical conditions on these components of the surface energy-momentum tensor.
We also discuss the formation of the event horizon inside the interior in the
case when the initial conditions are such that the situation describes a
collapsing matter cloud. We elaborate upon the physical implications of these
results.

**Abstract**: This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for a
next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino
physics. The detector will have an active liquid xenon target mass of 60-80
tonnes and is proposed by the XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN (XLZD) collaboration. The
design is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology
of the current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. A baseline design and
opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components
are discussed. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore
parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down
to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\sigma$ evidence potential for the
spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\times10^{-49}\rm
cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory is also projected to have a
3$\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe
at a half-life of up to $5.7\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is
sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the atmosphere, sun, and galactic
supernovae.

**Abstract**: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a
promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the
complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency.
However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the
existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user
equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing
investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it
complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing
(LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural
network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets,
which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a
graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as
node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to
the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model
exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network
topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single
trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional
optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal
throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders
of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the
network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.


### PhysORD: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Physics-infused Motion Prediction in Off-road Driving

**Abstract**: Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it
presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the
complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional
physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic
systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks
require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the
fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By
merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a
promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models,
potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no
prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To
bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the
conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural
models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that
PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance
by modeling uncertainties. The learned dynamics model achieves 46.7% higher
accuracy using only 3.1% of the parameters compared to data-driven methods,
demonstrating the data efficiency and superior generalization ability of our
neural-symbolic method.

**Abstract**: Protein inverse folding-that is, predicting an amino acid sequence that will
fold into the desired 3D structure-is an important problem for structure-based
protein design. Machine learning based methods for inverse folding typically
use recovery of the original sequence as the optimization objective. However,
inverse folding is a one-to-many problem where several sequences can fold to
the same structure. Moreover, for many practical applications, it is often
desirable to have multiple, diverse sequences that fold into the target
structure since it allows for more candidate sequences for downstream
optimizations. Here, we demonstrate that although recent inverse folding
methods show increased sequence recovery, their "foldable diversity"-i.e. their
ability to generate multiple non-similar sequences that fold into the
structures consistent with the target-does not increase. To address this, we
present RL-DIF, a categorical diffusion model for inverse folding that is
pre-trained on sequence recovery and tuned via reinforcement learning on
structural consistency. We find that RL-DIF achieves comparable sequence
recovery and structural consistency to benchmark models but shows greater
foldable diversity: experiments show RL-DIF can achieve an foldable diversity
of 29% on CATH 4.2, compared to 23% from models trained on the same dataset.
The PyTorch model weights and sampling code are available on GitHub.

**Abstract**: Customizing diffusion models to generate identity-preserving images from
user-provided reference images is an intriguing new problem. The prevalent
approaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to
achieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use
cases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free
technique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for
personalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified
flow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in
requiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point
solution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image
discriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when
anchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The
derived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf
image discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human
faces, live subjects, and certain objects. Code is available at

**Abstract**: Recently, the strong latent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has been
applied to high-quality Text-to-Image (T2I) generation (e.g., Stable
Diffusion), by injecting the encoded target text prompt into the gradually
denoised diffusion image generator. Despite the success of DPM in practice, the
mechanism behind it remains to be explored. To fill this blank, we begin by
examining the intermediate statuses during the gradual denoising generation
process in DPM. The empirical observations indicate, the shape of image is
reconstructed after the first few denoising steps, and then the image is filled
with details (e.g., texture). The phenomenon is because the low-frequency
signal (shape relevant) of the noisy image is not corrupted until the final
stage in the forward process (initial stage of generation) of adding noise in
DPM. Inspired by the observations, we proceed to explore the influence of each
token in the text prompt during the two stages. After a series of experiments
of T2I generations conditioned on a set of text prompts. We conclude that in
the earlier generation stage, the image is mostly decided by the special token
[\texttt{EOS}] in the text prompt, and the information in the text prompt is
already conveyed in this stage. After that, the diffusion model completes the
details of generated images by information from themselves. Finally, we propose
to apply this observation to accelerate the process of T2I generation by
properly removing text guidance, which finally accelerates the sampling up to
25\%+.


### MBD: Multi b-value Denoising of Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Images

**Abstract**: We propose a novel approach to denoising diffusion magnetic resonance images
(dMRI) using convolutional neural networks, that exploits the benefits of data
acquired at multiple b-values to offset the need for many redundant
observations. Denoising is especially relevant in dMRI since noise can have a
deleterious impact on both quantification accuracy and image preprocessing. The
most successful methods proposed to date, like Marchenko-Pastur Principal
Component Analysis (MPPCA) denoising, are tailored to diffusion-weighting
repeated for many encoding directions. They exploit high redundancy of the
dataset that oversamples the diffusion-encoding direction space, since many
directions have collinear components.
  However, there are many dMRI techniques that do not entail a large number of
encoding directions or repetitions, and are therefore less suited to this
approach. For example, clinical dMRI exams may include as few as three encoding
directions, with low or negligible data redundancy across directions. Moreover,
promising new dMRI approaches, like spherical b-tensor encoding (STE), benefit
from high b-values while sensitizing the signal to diffusion along all
directions in just a single shot.
  We introduce a convolutional neural network approach that we call
multi-b-value-based denoising (MBD). MBD exploits the similarity in
diffusion-weighted images (DWI) across different b-values but along the same
diffusion encoding direction. It allows denoising of diffusion images with high
noise variance while avoiding blurring, and using just a small number input
images.

**Abstract**: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by
injecting sophisticated designed perturbations to input data. Training-time
defenses still exhibit a significant performance gap between natural accuracy
and robust accuracy. In this paper, we investigate a new test-time adversarial
defense method via diffusion-based recovery along opposite adversarial paths
(OAPs). We present a purifier that can be plugged into a pre-trained model to
resist adversarial attacks. Different from prior arts, the key idea is
excessive denoising or purification by integrating the opposite adversarial
direction with reverse diffusion to push the input image further toward the
opposite adversarial direction. For the first time, we also exemplify the
pitfall of conducting AutoAttack (Rand) for diffusion-based defense methods.
Through the lens of time complexity, we examine the trade-off between the
effectiveness of adaptive attack and its computation complexity against our
defense. Experimental evaluation along with time cost analysis verifies the
effectiveness of the proposed method.
