**Abstract**: The quantum world is described by a unit vector in the Hilbert space and the
Hamiltonian. Do these abstract basis-independent objects give a complete
description of the physical world, or should we include observables like
positions and momenta and the decomposition into subsystems? According to
"Hilbert-space fundamentalism" they give a complete description, and all other
features of the physical world emerge from them (Carroll, arXiv:2103.09780).
Here I will give a concrete refutation of this thesis based on the symmetries
of the theory of quantum measurements. These results show that even if a tensor
product structure is assumed along with the unit vector and the Hamiltonian,
concrete physically distinct worlds can be described by the same structures.

**Abstract**: Recently the Belle II Collaboration has reported a measurement of the $B^+\to
K^+\nu\bar\nu$ rate that is higher than the standard-model expectation. Since
the emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excess could be due to the $B^+$
decaying into a $K^+$ and a dark-matter pair. We entertain this possibility in
a two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a real singlet scalar boson acting
as the dark matter. This model also accommodates strangeness-changing
interactions providing new sources of $CP$ violation which can affect hyperon
and kaon nonleptonic transitions. We find that the resulting $CP$ violation in
the hyperon sector can be significant, reaching the current empirical bounds,
after taking into account constraints from kaon mixing and decay and from
dark-matter relic-density data and direct searches including the Migdal effect.
We demonstrate that the hyperon and kaon processes are complementary probes of
this new-physics scenario. Its prediction for sizable hyperon $CP$ violation is
potentially testable in ongoing experiments, such as BESIII, Belle II, and
LHCb, and in next-generation ones like PANDA and at the Super Tau Charm
Facility.


### Shadow Molecular Dynamics for a Charge-Potential Equilibration Model
**Authors**: Robert Stanton, Cagri Mehmet Kaymak, Anders M. N. Niklasson

**Published Date**: 2025-02-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-13

**PDF Url**: [2502.09602v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09602v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the
Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration
model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes
both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow
for physically correct charge fragmentation and scaling of the polarizability.
Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible
charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian
Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration
approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with
finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential
fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust
and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse
physical phenomena and applications.


### Cosmological phase transitions from the functional measure

**Abstract**: We investigate how competitive gravitational wave detectors can be to current
and near-future colliders in probing a model where the new physics is
completely encapsulated in a modified scalar sector. For this, we study a model
where an additional logarithmic term arises in the scalar potential due to a
non-trivial path integral measure, which is constructed using effective field
theory. This new term alters the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions and
could lead to potentially detectable gravitational waves from the early
Universe. Our results confirm the expectation that the intensity of such
spectrum is highly correlated to the scalar field's self-coupling, and that
gravitational wave experiments could therefore be used to probe these couplings
with an accuracy competitive with the projected sensitivity of near-future
colliders.


### Semileptonic kaon decays and the precise determination of $V_{us}$
**Authors**: Chien-Yeah Seng

**Published Date**: 2025-02-07

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-13

**PDF Url**: [2502.04721v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04721v2)

**Abstract**: I will give a brief overview of the Standard Model theory inputs needed for
the precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element
$V_{us}$ from semileptonic kaon decays, focusing on the long-distance
electromagnetic corrections. I will then describe our recent effort to pin down
this correction at sub-permille level, which further sharpens the so-called
``Cabibbo angle anomaly'', an interesting observation which may point towards
new physics.


### Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene

**Abstract**: Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM)
Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are
essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator
groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model
by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To
develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include
strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We
find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order
perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space,
and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson
model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF
Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4
symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion
framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations
encountered in experiment.


### Negative neutrino masses as a mirage of dark energy

**PDF Url**: [2407.10965v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10965v2)

**Abstract**: The latest cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses depend
on prior physical assumptions about the mass spectrum. To test the accordance
of cosmological and laboratory constraints in the absence of such priors, we
introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter that extends consistently to
negative values. For the $\Lambda$CDM model, we analyze data from Planck, ACT,
and DESI and find a $2.8-3.3\sigma$ tension with the constraints from
oscillation experiments. Motivated by recent hints of evolving dark energy, we
analyze the $w_0w_a$ and mirage dark energy models, showing that they favour
larger masses consistent with laboratory data, respectively $\sum
m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.06_{-0.10}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum
m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.04_{-0.11}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ (both at 68%).

**Abstract**: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive
detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single
photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared
wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of
intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about
$40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a
superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable
to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction
to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper
cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and
detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the
increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark
count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To
confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their
super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We
discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and
note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.


### An Automated Bandwidth Division for the LHCb Upgrade Trigger
**Authors**: T. Evans, C. Fitzpatrick, J. Horswill

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-13

**PDF Url**: [2502.09557v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09557v1)

**Abstract**: The upgraded Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment is the first
detector based at a hadron collider using a fully software based trigger. The
first `High Level Trigger' stage (HLT1) reduces the event rate from 30 MHz to
approximately 1 MHz based on reconstruction criteria from the tracking system
and consists of O(100) trigger selections implemented on GPUs. These selections
are further refined following the full offline-quality reconstruction at the
second stage (HLT2) prior to saving for analysis. An automated bandwidth
division has been performed to equitably divide this 1 MHz output rate between
the signals of interest to the LHCb physics program. This was achieved by
optimising a set of trigger selections that maximise efficiency for signals of
interest to LHCb while keeping the total HLT1 readout capped to a maximum. The
bandwidth division tool has been used to determine the optimal selection for 35
selection algorithms over 80 characteristic physics channels.


### Explainable AI-assisted Optimization for Feynman Integral Reduction

**PDF Url**: [2502.09544v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09544v1)

**Abstract**: We present a novel approach to optimizing the reduction of Feynman integrals
using integration-by-parts identities. By developing a priority function
through the FunSearch algorithm, which combines large language models and
genetic algorithms, we achieve significant improvements in memory usage and
computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our approach
demonstrates substantial reductions in the required seeding integrals, making
previously intractable integrals more manageable. Tested on a variety of
Feynman integrals, including one-loop and multi-loop cases with planar and
non-planar configurations, our method demonstrates remarkable scalability and
adaptability. For reductions of certain Feynman integrals with many dots and
numerators, we observed an improvement by a factor of 3058 compared to
traditional methods. This work provides a powerful and interpretable framework
for optimizing IBP reductions, paving the way for more efficient and practical
calculations in high-energy physics.

### Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model

**Abstract**: Diffusion language models have emerged as a promising approach for text
generation. One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient
replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in
parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off
is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical
analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked
Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the
target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using
perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling
steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be
achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence
error rate--which is important for understanding the "correctness" of a
sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps
must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain "correct" sequences, thereby
eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis
establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and
limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical
studies.


### Score-of-Mixture Training: Training One-Step Generative Models Made Simple
**Authors**: Tejas Jayashankar, J. Jon Ryu, Gregory Wornell

**Published Date**: 2025-02-13

**Updated Date**: 2025-02-13

**PDF Url**: [2502.09609v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09609v1)

**Abstract**: We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training
one-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the
$\alpha$-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score
of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise
levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from
scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we
call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires
minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even
outperform existing methods.


### Rolling Ahead Diffusion for Traffic Scene Simulation

**Abstract**: Realistic driving simulation requires that NPCs not only mimic natural
driving behaviors but also react to the behavior of other simulated agents.
Recent developments in diffusion-based scenario generation focus on creating
diverse and realistic traffic scenarios by jointly modelling the motion of all
the agents in the scene. However, these traffic scenarios do not react when the
motion of agents deviates from their modelled trajectories. For example, the
ego-agent can be controlled by a stand along motion planner. To produce
reactive scenarios with joint scenario models, the model must regenerate the
scenario at each timestep based on new observations in a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) fashion. Although reactive, this method is time-consuming, as one
complete possible future for all NPCs is generated per simulation step.
Alternatively, one can utilize an autoregressive model (AR) to predict only the
immediate next-step future for all NPCs. Although faster, this method lacks the
capability for advanced planning. We present a rolling diffusion based traffic
scene generation model which mixes the benefits of both methods by predicting
the next step future and simultaneously predicting partially noised further
future steps at the same time. We show that such model is efficient compared to
diffusion model based AR, achieving a beneficial compromise between reactivity
and computational efficiency.


### DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra

**Abstract**: Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of
unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the
structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of
molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient
scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a
formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer
architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and
neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted
by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust
decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain
the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in
virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number
in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show
that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule
generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance
scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly
available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.

**Abstract**: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged
by the quality and quantity of training data which, whenever containing strong
spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels, can result
in unrecoverable biases in model predictions. Tackling these biases is crucial
in improving model generalization and trust, especially in real-world
scenarios. This paper presents Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting
as a plug-in for common methods in model debiasing while exploiting the
inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models. Our approach leverages
conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, used to
train a bias amplifier model, to be further employed as an auxiliary method in
different unsupervised debiasing approaches. Our proposed method, which also
tackles the common issue of training set memorization typical of this type of
tech- niques, beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets by
significant margins, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective
tool for tackling dataset bias in deep learning applications.
