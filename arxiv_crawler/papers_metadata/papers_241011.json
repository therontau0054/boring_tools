Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body\nphenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting\nBose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated\nhomogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent\nlow-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the\ninter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading\nof coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions,\nand faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit,\nwhere the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the\nratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust\nto changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our\nexperiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from\nequilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.",

            "summary": "This study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct\nmultiple flow fields in a transient natural convection system solely based on\ninstantaneous temperature data at an arbitrary moment. Transient convection\nproblems present reconstruction challenges due to the temporal variability of\nfields across different flow phases. In general, large reconstruction errors\nare observed during the incipient phase, while the quasi-steady phase exhibits\nrelatively smaller errors, reduced by a factor of 2 to 4. We hypothesize that\nreconstruction errors vary across different flow phases due to the changing\nsolution space of a PINN, inferred from the temporal gradients of the fields.\nFurthermore, we find that reconstruction errors tend to accumulate in regions\nwhere the spatial gradients are smaller than the order of $10^{-6}$, likely due\nto the vanishing gradient phenomenon. In convection phenomena, field variations\noften manifest across multiple scales in space. However, PINN-based\nreconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale\nvariations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem. To\nmitigate the errors associated with vanishing gradients, we introduce a\nmulti-scale approach that determines scaling constants for the PINN inputs and\nreformulates inputs across multiple scales. This approach improves the maximum\nand mean errors by 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Our research provides insights\ninto the behavior of PINNs when applied to transient convection problems with\nlarge solution space and field variations across multiple scales.",

Such models are now closely\nscrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness,\nor compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when\ndeploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a\ntendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we\npropose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion\nmodels to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this\nby adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation\ntrajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too\nclosely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the\nsense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and\neven more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named\nSPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set\nthat contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each\ntimestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We\nshow that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity\nwhile impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better\nthan other recent training-free diversity methods.
