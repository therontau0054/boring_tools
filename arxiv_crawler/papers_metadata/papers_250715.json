            "summary": "Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics\nChallenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial\nautonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is\nsoftware: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++\nexpertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark\ncontrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled\nmodern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework\ndesigned to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that\nallows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using\nstate-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)\nwhile seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.\nA lightweight client-server architecture provides networked\npublisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure\nreal-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,\nSLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with\nnative ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from\nmanipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless\nhardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of\nmainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices\nunder a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates\nresearch and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.",

However, due\nto the nonlinearity and complexity of MHD, obtaining accurate and robust\nnumerical solutions to MHD equations is non-trivial, and it may be challenging\nfor an approximate MHD Riemann solver to preserve the positivity of scalar\nvariables, particularly when the plasma beta is low. As we have identified that\nthe inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and\nmagnetic energy may be responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar\nvariables, we propose a physical consistency condition and implement it in\nHLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thus alleviating the erroneous magnetic field\nsolutions breaking scalar positivity. In addition, (I) for the HLLC-type\nscheme, we have designed a revised two-state approximation, specifically\nreducing numerical error in magnetic field solutions, and (II) for the\nHLLD-type scheme, we replace the constant total pressure assumption by a\nthree-state assumption for the intermediate thermal energy, which is more\nconsistent with our other assumptions.

We introduce\nBayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in\nneural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications\nwith 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through\nforests, where precise surface geometry and reliable uncertainty estimates are\nessential. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)\nor 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, Signed\nDistance Functions (SDFs) define continuous and differentiable geometry, making\nthem better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a\nLaplace approximation to quantify local surface instability using Hessian-based\nmetrics, enabling efficient, surfaceaware uncertainty estimation. Our method\nshows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed\ngeometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use.\nExtensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that\nBayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric\nconsistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene\nreconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.",
