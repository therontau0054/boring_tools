Mu3e is one of the flagship experiments of the Swiss particle\nphysics scene, aiming to search for the charged lepton flavour violating\n(neutrinoless) muon decay $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$. Mu3e is planned to\nstart taking data in 2025 at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, using\nthe most intense continuous surface muon beam in the world (10$^8$ muons per\nsecond).\n  At the University of Geneva, together with partners from ETH Zurich, we are\ndeveloping a scintillating fibre detector formed by staggering three layers of\n250 $\\mu m$ diameter round scintillating fibres. The fibre ribbons are coupled\nat both ends to multi-channel silicon photo-multiplier arrays, which are read\nout with the MuTRiG ASIC, specifically developed for this experiment.\n  This presentation is focused on the performances of the scintillating fibre\ndetector, notably on the time resolution around 250 ps, the efficiency greater\nthan 97\\% and the spatial resolution of $\\sim$ 100 $\\mu m$. In this\npresentation, we also include the challenges overcome to build this very thin\nscintillating fibre detector, having a thickness smaller than 0.2\\% of the\nradiation length. Furthermore, we discuss the operation and performance of the\nMuTRiG ASIC, used for reading out the 3072 channels of the fibre detector.",

Using magnetogram\ncut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active\nregion morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the\noccurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of\nCME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind\nmeasurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to\nsound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed\nunprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as\none minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in\npredicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the\ngeomagnetic storm.

This\ntechnique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and\nmedicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron\nlocation and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs)\nhave facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering\nlatent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and\nneuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference\nalgorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their\napplicability for single-neuron analyses.

Our approach embeds individual neurons'\nspatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for\nspike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by\ngenerating more informative and discriminative latent representations,\nimproving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of\nneuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE\noutperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately\nrecover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using\nrealistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical\nproperties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between\ndifferent firing and connectivity types.

            "summary": "Non-classical correlations resulting from entangled quantum systems have\nsparked debates about the compatibility of quantum theory and relativity, and\nabout the right way to think about causation. Key to a causal theory is that\nsuperluminal signalling is forbidden, which holds in quantum theory. In Bell\nscenarios, relativistic causality principles like no superluminal signalling\nare often assumed to follow from the standard no-signalling constraints on\ncorrelations. We explore the connections between a range of relativistic\nprinciples, including no superluminal signalling and no causal loops, and\nconstraints on correlations that can arise with arbitrary interventions, within\nmulti-party Bell scenarios. This includes standard no-signalling conditions and\nproposed relaxations allowing phenomena like jamming, where it was suggested\nthat superluminal signalling and causal loops remain impossible. Using our\nrecent framework combining relativistic principles with causal modelling, we\nshow that any theory (classical or non-classical) allowing jamming must rely on\ncausal fine-tuning and superluminal causal influences. Additionally, we show\nthat jamming theories can lead to superluminal signalling in certain\nsituations, highlighting limitations for their physicality. However, we\nidentify cases where jamming correlations avoid superluminal signalling under\ngeneral interventions, demonstrating that standard no-signalling constraints\nare not necessary for this purpose. We also show that these constraints are\ninsufficient to rule out superluminal signalling and are neither necessary nor\nsufficient for ensuring no causal loops under general interventions. Finally,\nwe derive necessary and sufficient conditions for ruling out superluminal\nsignalling and operationally detectable causal loops, solidifying our\nunderstanding of relativistic causality principles in information processing\ntasks in space-time.",
