It\ncan, for example, appear when the potential energy between two particles\nincreases with separation, as if they were connected by a tense string. Beyond\na critical separation, new particle pairs can form, causing the string to\nbreak. String-breaking dynamics in quantum chromodynamics play a vital role in\nhigh-energy particle collisions and early universe evolution. Simulating string\nevolution and hadron formation is, therefore, a grand challenge in modern\nphysics. Quantum simulators, well-suited for studying dynamics, are expected to\noutperform classical computing methods. However, the required experimental\ncapabilities to simulate string-breaking dynamics have not yet been\ndemonstrated, even for simpler models of the strong force. We experimentally\nprobe, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of string-breaking in a\n(1+1)-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory using a fully\nprogrammable trapped-ion quantum simulator. We emulate external static charges\nand strings via site-dependent magnetic-field control enabled by a dual array\nof tightly focused laser beams targeting individual ions. First, we study how\nconfinement affects isolated charges, finding that they freely spread without\nstring tension but exhibit localized oscillations when tension is increased.\nThen, we observe and characterize string-breaking dynamics of a string\nstretched between two static charges after an abrupt increase in string\ntension. Charge pairs appear near the string edges and spread into the bulk,\nrevealing a route to dynamical string-breaking distinct from the conventional\nSchwinger mechanism. Our work demonstrates that analog quantum simulators have\nachieved the necessary control to explore string-breaking dynamics, which may\nultimately be relevant to nuclear and high-energy physics.",

While machine learning-based surrogate models can offer significant\ncost reductions, most focus on a single task, such as forward prediction, and\ntypically lack uncertainty quantification -- an essential component in many\napplications. To overcome these limitations, we propose Arbitrarily-Conditioned\nMulti-Functional Diffusion (ACMFD), a versatile probabilistic surrogate model\nfor multi-physics emulation. ACMFD can perform a wide range of tasks within a\nsingle framework, including forward prediction, various inverse problems, and\nsimulating data for entire systems or subsets of quantities conditioned on\nothers. Specifically, we extend the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic\nModel (DDPM) for multi-functional generation by modeling noise as Gaussian\nprocesses (GP). We then introduce an innovative denoising loss. The training\ninvolves randomly sampling the conditioned part and fitting the corresponding\npredicted noise to zero, enabling ACMFD to flexibly generate function values\nconditioned on any other functions or quantities. To enable efficient training\nand sampling, and to flexibly handle irregularly sampled data, we use GPs to\ninterpolate function samples onto a grid, inducing a Kronecker product\nstructure for efficient computation.

Therefore, generative protein modeling\nnecessitates a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and\ngenerate both sequences and structures. However, existing methods typically use\nseparate models for each modality, limiting their ability to capture the\nintricate relationships between sequence and structure. This results in\nsuboptimal performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and\ngeneration of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce DPLM-2, a multimodal\nprotein foundation model that extends discrete diffusion protein language model\n(DPLM) to accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable structural\nlearning with the language model, 3D coordinates are converted to discrete\ntokens using a lookup-free quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both\nexperimental and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint\ndistribution of sequence and structure, as well as their marginals and\nconditionals. We also implement an efficient warm-up strategy to exploit the\nconnection between large-scale evolutionary data and structural inductive\nbiases from pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical\nevaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate highly compatible\namino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D structures eliminating the need\nfor a two-stage generation approach.
