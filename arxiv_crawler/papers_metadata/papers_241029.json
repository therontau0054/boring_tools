However, training data are typically\nscarce in practice, and these black-box models often fail to generalize.\nModeling architectures that leverage known physics can substantially reduce the\ncomplexity of system-identification, but break down in the face of complex\nphenomena such as contact. We introduce a novel framework for learning\nsemi-structured dynamics models for contact-rich systems which seamlessly\nintegrates structured first principles modeling techniques with black-box\nauto-regressive models. Specifically, we develop an ensemble of probabilistic\nmodels to estimate external forces, conditioned on historical observations and\nactions, and integrate these predictions using known Lagrangian dynamics. With\nthis semi-structured approach, we can make accurate long-horizon predictions\nwith substantially less data than prior methods. We leverage this capability\nand propose Semi-Structured Reinforcement Learning ($\\texttt{SSRL}$) a simple\nmodel-based learning framework which pushes the sample complexity boundary for\nreal-world learning. We validate our approach on a real-world Unitree Go1\nquadruped robot, learning dynamic gaits -- from scratch -- on both hard and\nsoft surfaces with just a few minutes of real-world data.

As a standard\nmodel, we study hypergraph states, a representative class of many-body magic\nstates, subject to depolarizing noise. First, we show that interactions\nfacilitated by high-degree gates are fragile to noise. In particular, the\n$\\mathrm{C}^{n-1}Z$ state family exhibits a vanishing magic threshold of\n$\\Theta(1/n)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficiently preparable families of\nhypergraph states without local magic but with a non-vanishing magic threshold\nwhich signifies robust magic that is entirely embedded in global entanglement.\nWe also discuss the qudit case based on the discrete Wigner formalism.",

Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive\nfermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel\nplates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To\ncalculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a\nMIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order\nderivative term in the modified Dirac equation.
