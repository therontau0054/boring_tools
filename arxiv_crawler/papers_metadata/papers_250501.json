            "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world\ndecision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when\nfine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities\nwhile being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning\nprocess introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially\nin safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first\ncomprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making\nsystems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and\ntrigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms:\nword injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting\nvarious components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform\nextensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in\nautonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and\nstealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with\ncases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on\nbeds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate\nacross multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the\nsystem. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%,\nreaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also\nassess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their\nresilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in\nembodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these\nsystems to mitigate potential risks.",

            "summary": "High-profile speech videos are prime targets for falsification, owing to\ntheir accessibility and influence. This work proposes Spotlight, a low-overhead\nand unobtrusive system for protecting live speech videos from visual\nfalsification of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike predominant\nfalsification detection methods operating in the digital domain, Spotlight\ncreates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all\nvideo recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures\nencode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including\nthe speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to\nprevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and\nvalidated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key\nelements of Spotlight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact\n(i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on\nlocality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds\n>200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live.\nPrototype experiments on extensive video datasets show Spotlight achieves AUCs\n$\\geq$ 0.99 and an overall true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified\nvideos. Further, Spotlight is highly robust across recording conditions, video\npost-processing techniques, and white-box adversarial attacks on its video\nfeature extraction methodologies.",

As in the classical case,\nstopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders\nfor quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an\nattractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in\nconjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity.

            "summary": "Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate for fast solvers\nfor combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and has attracted the interest\nof many researchers. Since COP is logically encoded in the Ising interaction\namong spins, its realization necessitates a spin system with all-to-all\nconnectivity, presenting technical challenges in the physical implementation of\nlarge-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed a\nparity-encoding (PE) architecture consisting of an expanded spin system with\nonly local connectivity among them to circumvent this difficulty in developing\nnear-future QA devices. They suggested that this architecture not only\nalleviates implementation challenges and enhances scalability but also\npossesses intrinsic fault tolerance. This paper proposes a practical decoding\nmethod tailored to correlated spin-flip errors in spin readout of PE\narchitecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture\nand classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We show that the bit-flip\n(BF) decoding algorithm can correct independent and identically distributed\nerrors in the readout of the SLHZ system with comparable performance to the\nbelief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Then, we show evidence that the\nproposed BF decoding algorithm can efficiently correct correlated spinflip\nerrors by simulation. The result suggests that introducing post-readout BF\ndecoding reduces the computational cost of QA using the PE architecture and\nimproves the performance of global optimal solution search. Our results\nemphasize the importance of the proper selection of decoding algorithms to\nexploit the inherent fault tolerance potential of the PE architecture.",

            "summary": "Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion\nmodels for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as\nendpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation,\nDDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the\nsimulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network\nevaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs\nwithout extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion\nmodels. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges\ndefined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same\nmarginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative\nprocesses ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion\nbridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\\times$ faster than\nthe vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful\nform of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order\nnumerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a\ndistinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which\nenables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image\ntranslation tasks.

            "authors": "Yichi Zhang, Mihai Cucuringu, Alexander Y. Shestopaloff, Stefan Zohren",
            "summary": "In the rapidly evolving world of financial markets, understanding the\ndynamics of limit order book (LOB) is crucial for unraveling market\nmicrostructure and participant behavior. We introduce ClusterLOB as a method to\ncluster individual market events in a stream of market-by-order (MBO) data into\ndifferent groups. To do so, each market event is augmented with six\ntime-dependent features. By applying the K-means++ clustering algorithm to the\nresulting order features, we are then able to assign each new order to one of\nthree distinct clusters, which we identify as directional, opportunistic, and\nmarket-making participants, each capturing unique trading behaviors. Our\nexperimental results are performed on one year of MBO data containing\nsmall-tick, medium-tick, and large-tick stocks from NASDAQ. To validate the\nusefulness of our clustering, we compute order flow imbalances across each\ncluster within 30-minute buckets during the trading day. We treat each\ncluster's imbalance as a signal that provides insights into trading strategies\nand participants' responses to varying market conditions. To assess the\neffectiveness of these signals, we identify the trading strategy with the\nhighest Sharpe ratio in the training dataset, and demonstrate that its\nperformance in the test dataset is superior to benchmark trading strategies\nthat do not incorporate clustering. We also evaluate trading strategies based\non order flow imbalance decompositions across different market event types,\nincluding add, cancel, and trade events, to assess their robustness in various\nmarket conditions. This work establishes a robust framework for clustering\nmarket participant behavior, which helps us to better understand market\nmicrostructure, and inform the development of more effective predictive trading\nsignals with practical applications in algorithmic trading and quantitative\nfinance.",
