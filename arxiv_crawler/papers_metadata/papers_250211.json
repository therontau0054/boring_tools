We investigate the underlying\nphysical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion,\nand motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing,\nthree-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing\ntransition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion\ndominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale\ndiffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale\ndiffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This\nconfinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold,\nleading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging\ntimescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a\nphenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition:\nSteric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold,\nand the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our\nstudy highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility\nwith global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a\nbaseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for\nexample in tissue spheroids.
