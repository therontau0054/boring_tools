However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear.\nHere, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental\nband crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating\ncandidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state\ncharacteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2\nchiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states.\nOur results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi\narcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoe-\nmission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials\nand experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our\nunderstanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic\nsymmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.",

In this work, we investigate how to achieve\nthis goal with the quantum double model $\\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific\nnon-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a\nqubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for\ncreating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design\na specialized anyon interferometer to measure the total charge remotely for\nwell-separated anyons; this avoids fusing them together. These protocols enable\nthe implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active\nquantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation\nprocess. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we\nencode each physical degree of freedom of $\\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel,\nquantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the\nlogical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal\noffers a promising path to realize universal topological quantum computation in\nthe NISQ era.",

We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is\nautomatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting\nthe cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we\ndevelop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which\ndictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\\ell$-loop\ngraph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction\ncoefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues\nthat factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat\nspace amplitudes.

            "summary": "Advancements in computing power have made it possible to numerically simulate\nlarge-scale fluid-mechanical and/or particulate systems, many of which are\nintegral to core industrial processes. Among the different numerical methods\navailable, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate\nrepresentations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and\ndiscontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is\ncomputationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of\nparticulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles.\nTowards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow\nnumerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM\nis capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes\nusing macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model\nparameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an\nunderlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior\ndirectly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces\nmulti-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of\nindustrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and\ntransient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for\ndeep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM\nfluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for\ntrajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering\nand much faster process cycles.",

            "summary": "Accurate modeling of terrestrial carbon and water exchange requires robust\necological parameters that capture vegetation responses and adaptations to the\nlocal environment. The current generation of land models use Plant Functional\nTypes (PFTs) to discretize vegetation functional diversity, but these coarse\ncategorizations often overlook fine-scale variations shaped by local climate,\nsoil, and forest age factors. The lack of governing equations for plant\nadaptation demands a paradigm shift in how we integrate diverse Earth\nobservations to uncover ecological functional dependence on changing\nenvironments. To address this challenge, we developed DifferLand, a\ndifferentiable, hybrid physics and machine learning model that infers the\nspatial distributions of ecological parameters and their relationships with\nenvironmental factors constrained by satellite and in-situ observations. Our\nmodel unifies top-down and bottom-up observational constraints with\nprocess-based knowledge to generate a global analysis of ecological functions\nand their adaptation to environmental gradients. We found PFTs account for less\nthan half of the explainable spatial parameter variations controlling carbon\nfluxes and vegetation states. The remaining parameter variability is largely\ndriven by local climate and forest demography factors, and the learned\nenvironment-parameter relationships lead to enhanced spatial generalization at\nunseen locations. DifferLand identified growing season length, leaf economics,\nand agricultural intensity as the three orthogonal spatial gradients underlying\nparameter variations. Our novel framework can lead to new insights on global\ncarbon cycling by learning directly from data and expanding our understanding\nof local responses of ecosystems to environmental drivers.",

Next, these\npartial-wave amplitudes are unitarized based on analyticity and unitarity by\nemploying three different methods of unitarization: the algebraic $N/D$ method,\nthe Inverse Amplitude Method and the first iterated $N/D$ method. Then, we have\nstudied several partial waves both for physical momentum and for complex ones\nto look for bound-state poles. The binding momentum for the fundamental bound\nstate in $S$ wave is discussed with special detail.

To learn\ngolden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in\nthis paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \\textit{noise prompt},\nwhich aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a\nsmall desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the\nconcept, we first formulate the \\textit{noise prompt learning} framework that\nsystematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt\nfor diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline\nand collect a large-scale \\textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains\n100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts.\nWith the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \\textit{noise\nprompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise\ninto a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as\na kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored\nto the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the\nimpressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality\nof synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL,\nDreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and\nefficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited\nadditional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden\nnoise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.",
