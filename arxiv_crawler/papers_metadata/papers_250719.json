After introducing a coarse-grained\ndescription of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium\nconfiguration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply\nthe coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the\neffective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs\nconstraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction\nand subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the\neffective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko\nmode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order\nactions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.",

This problem, which occurs\nin spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number\nof inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular\nwill arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect\ndifferent facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is\ndirectly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\\\"odinger picture\nof evolution, and of evolution via \"many-fingered time.\" One requires a\ncondition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general\nthis equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it\nis determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard\ncondition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which\nalso may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the\nstate in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the\nnon-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of\nthese approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution.

This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry\nbreaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for\ncertain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a\nrigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models\nwith local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs.\nTo this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the\nmathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check\n(LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees\nextensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional\nassumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the\nlow-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an\nasymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the\nlandscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of\nthe total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states --\nwhich we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and\ntreats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those\nwith short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our\nresults apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p,\nand while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family\nof codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random\nregular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both\nmodels undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to\nthe onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.",

We infer the diffusivity (as a function of inserted lithium\nconcentration) by minimising the residual sum of squares between data and\nsolutions to a spherically-symmetric nonlinear diffusion model in a single\nrepresentative active material particle. Using data harvested from the NMC\ncathode of a commercial LG M50 cell we demonstrate that the ICM is robust, and\nyields more accurate diffusivity estimates, while relying on data that are five\ntimes faster to collect than that required by the classical approach. Moreover,\nthere is good reason to believe that further speed ups could be achieved when\nother types of data are available.

Our proposal is tested successfully\nwith the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings,\naperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither\nperiodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient\nis able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from\nalphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior.

This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of\nquantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an\nadditional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter\nand dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed\ncomoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the\nFriedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for\nscale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times\n($a\\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such\nas big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks.
