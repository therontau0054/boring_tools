            "summary": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power\ngrids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations,\ncausing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example,\nundetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake.\nICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed\nto attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive\nmechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS\nphysical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating\nthe noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors\nproduce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.\n  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity\nof ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy\nphysical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by\nestimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random\nForest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or\nare limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of\nmeasurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of\ncomplex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a\ncase study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare\nthe performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative\nnoise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of\nup to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best\ndistribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution\nprovided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot\nfidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.",

            "summary": "Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more\nsimplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental\nperspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper,\nwe propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and\ngeneralizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat\nspacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by\nconsidering BMS-like symmetries for \"asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons\",\nor A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector\nfield satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The\nconstruction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of\nthe Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with\ndifferent dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the\nresults by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing\nhorizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a\nlarger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of \"superdilations\". We\nspeculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work,\nincluding the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general\nrelativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in\nterms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter\nspacetime and Killing horizons.",

In such\npolychromatic field, only two frequency components that are most resonant with\natomic optical transitions are taken into account accurately, while all other\noff-resonant components are taken into account using the second-order\nperturbation theory in the field. Within the presented concept, equation for\natomic density matrix is obtained, in which the contribution of all\noff-resonant components is reduced to the appearance of two new operators\n(non-diagonal, in general case): the shift operator and relaxation operators.\nIn the case of three-level $\\Lambda$-system, the adequacy of presented\neffective model was verified by numerical calculations of various dependencies,\nin which we did not find visual differences from the exact calculations. In\naddition to a significant mathematical simplification, our model provides a\nclear physical picture of various features of CPT spectroscopy in a\nperiodically modulated laser field, including effects that have not been\ndiscussed in the scientific literature before. In particular, we show that the\nwidespread viewpoint that the CPT resonance shift is determined by usual ac\nStark shifts of the lower levels is, in general, fundamentally incorrect, since\nthe contribution to the light shift due to beats at the frequency $\\Delta_{\\rm\nhfs}$ between different off-resonant frequency components can be comparable (or\neven dominate) with the standard ac Stark shift. Therefore, even if we have\ndetailed information on the modulated field spectrum (e.g. using a spectrum\nanalyzer), this is, in general, absolutely insufficient to determine the light\nshift of CPT resonance.",

The main difficulty comes from the presence of unstable\nand chaotic motions, which make long-term prediction impossible.

We consider the planar full three-body problem,\nformulated as a perturbation of both the Kepler problem and the planar circular\nrestricted three-body problem. We show that the system exhibits Arnold\ndiffusion, in the sense that there is a transfer of energy -- of an amount\nindependent of the perturbation parameter -- between the Kepler problem and the\nrestricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on the topological method\nof correctly aligned windows, which is implemented into a computer assisted\nproof. We demonstrate that the approach can be applied to physically relevant\nmasses of the bodies, choosing a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system as an example.\nIn this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation\nparameter and for the diffusion time.",

Thus,\nthere is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of\nmodeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood\nforecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we\npresent RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with\nlong-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and\nfloods on a $0.05^\\circ$ grid up to 7 days lead time, which is of high\nrelevance in early warning.
