Many\nexisting approaches achieve this by integrating physical operators into neural\nnetworks. While these methods offer theoretical guarantees, they face two key\nlimitations: (i) they primarily model local relations between adjacent time\nsteps, overlooking longer-range or higher-level physical interactions, and (ii)\nthey focus on forward simulation while neglecting broader physical reasoning\ntasks. We propose the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework\nthat generalizes Hamiltonian mechanics operators into more flexible neural\noperators. DHN captures non-local temporal relationships and mitigates\nnumerical integration errors through a denoising mechanism. DHN also supports\nmulti-system modeling with a global conditioning mechanism. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness and flexibility across three diverse physical reasoning tasks\nwith distinct inputs and outputs.",

Focusing on a\nspecific limit of $2 \\to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we\nfind that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when\nthe CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement\nwith observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional\nangles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)\nmatrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum\nentanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a\nsmaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for\nsuppressed CP violation.

A key challenge in these signal network applications\nis verifying the level of service that was actually provided by network\nparticipants.\n  We first establish a condition called source identifiability, which we show\nis necessary for the existence of a mechanism for which truthful signal\nreporting is a strict equilibrium. For a converse, we build on techniques from\npeer prediction to show that in every signal network that satisfies the source\nidentifiability condition, there is in fact a strictly truthful mechanism,\nwhere truthful signal reporting gives strictly higher total expected payoff\nthan any less informative equilibrium. We furthermore show that this truthful\nequilibrium is in fact the unique equilibrium of the mechanism if there is\npositive probability that any one observer is unconditionally honest (e.g., if\nan observer were run by the network owner). Also, by extending our condition to\ncoalitions, we show that there are generally no collusion-resistant mechanisms\nin the settings that we consider.\n  We apply our framework and results to two DePIN applications: proving\nlocation, and proving bandwidth. In the location-proving setting observers\nlearn (potentially enlarged) Euclidean distances to the source.

Our approach combines rigorous\ntechnical analysis, quantitative risk assessment, and normative evaluation to\nexpose systemic vulnerabilities inherent in opaque, black-box models. Detailed\ncase studies, including analyses of Microsoft Tay (2016) and the UK A-Level\nGrading Algorithm (2020), demonstrate how security lapses, bias amplification,\nand lack of accountability can precipitate cascading failures that undermine\npublic trust. We conclude by outlining targeted strategies for enhancing AI\nresilience through adaptive regulatory mechanisms, robust security protocols,\nand interdisciplinary oversight, thereby advancing the state of the art in\nethical and technical AI governance.",
