            "summary": "The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter\n(DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly\ncompact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions,\nhalos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the\ncentral region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse\nphase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand\nnumerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better\nunderstanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body\nsimulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external\ngravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of\nthe stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to\nenergy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially\nspeed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can\ndescribe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have\nsimulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we\nmake the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the\ncurrent numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late\ncollapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g.\nthat the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to\nrun simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations\nof GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.",

The key is to represent the propagation across\nthe piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths\n($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a\ncertain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each\nindividual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of\ntransmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique\nis combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in\nfrequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the\nfinite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their\nassociated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths\nto find the final result.

In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for\nControl (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of\nOrdinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to\nthe PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible\nflows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC\nmodel for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which\nlearns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a\ntransient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary\nconditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality\nof the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the\nefficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the\nderivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We\nvalidate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the\nPINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without\nlabeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control\napplications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently\napproximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a\npromising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering\napplications.",

However, the inclusion of interparticle\nfields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during\ncoherent emission. Here we present (i) an analytical proof showing that the\nenergy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which\nis divergence free and describes a generic system of interacting charges,\nrespects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple\ngeneralization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of\nthe total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By\nperforming first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic\nbunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this\ntheory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle\nfields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined\neffect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the\nparticle energy distribution.

However, bridging this success to real-world applications\nremains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot\naction. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,\nthat is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental\nrepresentations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task\nof Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored\nsetting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through\nmulti-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful\ninteractive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with\nclear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or\nabstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective\nfor users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative\nmulti-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to\nexplicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic\nvisual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to\nrefine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully\nautomated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing\ninteractive methods in the MIR scenario.

To explain this phenomenon, we combine\nexperiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the\nlearned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up\nto a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it.
