            "summary": "$k$-uniform states are valuable resources in quantum information, enabling\ntasks such as teleportation, error correction, and accelerated quantum\nsimulations. The practical realization of $k$-uniform states, at scale, faces\nmajor obstacles: verifying $k$-uniformity is as difficult as measuring code\ndistances, and devising fault-tolerant preparation protocols further adds to\nthe complexity. To address these challenges, we present a scalable,\nfault-tolerant method for preparing encoded $k$-uniform states, and we\nillustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a\ntechnique to determine $k$-uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their\nstabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures\nboth fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the\nencoded $k$-uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy\nthat retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while\nlowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully\nlogical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully\nphysical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by\nexplicit constructions of $k$-uniform states.",

            "summary": "The electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is crucial for cosmology and particle\nphysics, with a profound impact on electroweak baryogenesis, symmetry breaking,\nand gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, many studies overlook key aspects\nof EWPT dynamics, leading to misidentified patterns and overestimated GW\nsignals. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive framework for\nanalyzing EWPTs, focusing on the vacuum's thermal history and dynamics from\nbubble nucleation to percolation. Using the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real scalar\nsinglet model, we demonstrate the occurrence of spontaneous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry breaking in the high-temperature vacuum, leading to diverse EWPT\nprocesses, including multi-step transitions and inverse symmetry breaking. We\nidentify four distinct EWPT patterns, each characterized by unique\nsymmetry-breaking mechanisms and associated with bubbles exhibiting distinct\nfield configurations, which can be analyzed using a formalism based on energy\ndensity distributions developed here. A key finding is that bubble nucleation\nfails in extremely strong phase transitions (PTs) with low nucleation rates, or\nin ultra-fast PTs involving inverse $s$-bubbles that collapse instantly upon\nformation, both of which lead to false vacuum trapping and the absence of\nobservable GW signals. In first-order PTs where nucleation succeeds, stronger\ntransitions occur later in the universe's evolution, while weaker transitions\nproceed more rapidly. Multi-step transitions involving (inverse) $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry breaking give rise to complex transition sequences and exotic bubble\ndynamics, such as sequential nucleation or the coexistence of bubbles from\ndifferent vacua -- phenomena with significant implications for GW spectra, dark\nmatter, and baryogenesis. This work advances our understanding of EWPT dynamics\nand lays the groundwork for future studies of EWPTs in BSM physics.",

Next, in the planar\nsetting, we demonstrate the existence of large time-periodic solutions forced\nby intrinsic curvature relevant to undulatory swimming. Finally, the majority\nof the paper is devoted to the evolution of an immersed Kirchhoff rod in 3D,\nwhich involves a strong coupling between the curve and frame.

Applying this framework to\nhuman gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from\nphylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in\nmetabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances\nreveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific\nmetabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic\nperturbations.

In particular, by dint of Pauli blocking even modes\nof the distribution function relax over significantly shorter length scales\nthan odd modes (dubbed the ``tomographic'' effect). We establish an analytical\ndescription of tomographic electron flow in a channel, and find four new\ndistinguishing features: (i) Non-equilibrium effects from the boundaries\npenetrate significantly deeper into the flow domain; (ii) an additional\nvelocity slip condition leads to a significant increase in the channel\nconductance; (iii) bulk rarefaction corrections decrease the curvature of the\nvelocity profile in the channel center; and (iv) all these anomalous transport\neffects are rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields.
