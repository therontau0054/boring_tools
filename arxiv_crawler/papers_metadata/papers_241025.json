Simulations, which can predict these sensors' behaviour and\nperformance under anticipated accelerator conditions, are valuable tools to\nensure confidence in the sensors' functionality prior to a physical bench test.\nThis paper details the design, testing, and results of two sensor models\ndeveloped using CST Studio Suite software. One model is an elliptical,\nlarge-aperture beam position monitor (BPM) for which vertical & horizontal\nposition signal linearity was analyzed. The second model is an AC current\ntransformer (ACCT) beam current monitor (BCM), which was used to search for\npotential fault cases within the BCM and beam pipe flange gaps. Fermilab Proton\nImprovement Plan II (PIP-II) accelerator beam conditions were applied, and\nspecial focus is given to the discovery of linearity variations within the BPM\nas well as the use of frequency domain techniques in the BCM fault case\nanalyses.",

For the case of one-dimensional PEPS (Matrix\nProduct States - MPS) a bidirectional connection was established between the\ninternal structure of the tensor network, i.e. the mathematical properties of\nthe constituent tensors, and the symmetry. In higher dimensions this has only\nbeen done for global symmetries, where in the local (gauge) case it is known\nonly how to construct gauge-invariant states, but not what the symmetry implies\non the internal structure of the PEPS. In the present work we complete this\nmissing piece and study the internal structure of projected entangled pair\nstates with a gauge symmetry.

To\ninvestigate the efficacy of RANS-PINN as a viable approach to building\nparametric surrogate models, we investigate its accuracy in predicting relevant\nturbulent flow variables for both internal and external flows.

QMBSs are non-thermal highly\nexcited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of\nmany-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical\nmodels, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg\nsimulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what\nmodels they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate\nthat QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes\nPXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show\nthat in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on\na different approximate $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory\ndynamics in all cases.

            "summary": "Weather and climate data are often available at limited temporal resolution,\neither due to storage limitations, or in the case of weather forecast models\nbased on deep learning, their inherently long time steps. The coarse temporal\nresolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructs\nthe atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known.\nThe model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourier\nneural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather prediction\nand other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulated\nAFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolation\ntarget time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operation\ninside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can be\nused to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between two\ntime steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 h\nresolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishable\nfrom the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSE\nloss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared to\nlinear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce the\nstatistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves better\nthan 6 h resolution data. The ModAFNO layer is generic and is expected to be\napplicable to other problems, including weather forecasting with tunable lead\ntime.",

This thesis explores the intricate relationship between quantum\nmechanics and thermodynamics, with a particular focus on minimizing entropy\nproduction in finite-time processes. By employing tools from quantum\ninformation theory and geometric thermodynamics, we tackle the challenge of\nderiving irreversible thermodynamic behavior from the reversible microscopic\nframework of quantum mechanics. We begin with a comprehensive review of the\nlaws of thermodynamics, setting the stage for the subsequent analyses. We\nintroduce novel developments in quantum thermodynamics through a generalized\nframework for geometric thermodynamics, which enables the derivation of\nfinite-time corrections beyond the Markovian regime. Building on this\nfoundation, we extend Landauer's principle by incorporating a finite-time\ncorrection that highlights the necessity of strong coupling for optimal\ninformation erasure processes. This result underscores the emergence of\nPlanckian time as a fundamental speed limit to thermalization. Additionally, we\nexplore how collective effects can be harnessed to reduce energy dissipation in\nthermodynamic operations, revealing that classical correlations between systems\ncan significantly mitigate dissipation, though this may pose new questions\nregarding the third law of thermodynamics. Finally, we optimize thermodynamic\nprocesses in mesoscopic systems, including quantum dot engines and information\nengines. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the fundamental\nlimits of irreversibility but also open new avenues for research. Future works\nwill focus on fully exploiting collective effects, aligning these with the\nthird law of thermodynamics, and understanding the thermodynamic consistency of\nmaster equations.",

A promising way to overcome\nthese roadblocks is offered by quantum computers, which are based on the same\nlaws that make the classical computations so difficult. Here, we present a\nquantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of\ntwo-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields\nand matter.

Qudits are ideally suited for\ndescribing gauge fields, which are naturally high-dimensional, leading to a\ndramatic reduction in the quantum register size and circuit complexity. Using a\nvariational quantum eigensolver, we find the ground state of the model and\nobserve the interplay between virtual pair creation and quantized magnetic\nfield effects.
