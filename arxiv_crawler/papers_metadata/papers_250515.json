Such transitions underlie many phenomena in\ncosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They\ngive rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either\nthermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how\nthese states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime.\nHere, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics\nof ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized\ndomains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand\nas the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition.\nImplementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent\ninteractions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the\nHamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the\nsystem out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and\nevolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the\nmechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium\nscaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized\nKibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators\nto probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble\nnucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with\napplication to studies of matter formation in the early universe.",

            "summary": "Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers\nrequires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of\ntruncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the\ncomplexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example,\na truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of\n$Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings\nrequired to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an\nexponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For\nlattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several\nHamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in\nrecent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the\norbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the\nexponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.\nSpecifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit,\nor, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained\nwith circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as\nan exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the\norbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework,\nadvocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators\nprovides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit\ncomplexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice\nHamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations\nbased on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the\nresource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.",

The experiment was carried out with two light\nsources that only differ in their coherence length. In the case of the highly\ncoherent light source, we were able to combine the previously split parts of\nthe light back into a single beam. This is indicative of the reversibility of\nthe process of coherent light transmission through the interface. The light\nsource with low coherence length, on the contrary, does not allow for such a\nrecombination, thus producing an irreversible process. We explain how the\nlatter case is analogous to the process of interfacial heat transport, thus\nestablishing an important connection between optical non-coherence and\nirreversibility of transport phenomena.

            "summary": "Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for\nmany robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments\nacross four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and\naccelerates policy training by more than 10x.",

            "summary": "This paper demonstrates that a broad class of problems in quantitative\nfinance, including those previously addressed using deep neural networks, can\nbe efficiently solved using single-layer neural networks without iterative\ngradient-based training, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). ELM utilizes a\nsingle-layer network with randomly initialized hidden nodes and analytically\ncomputed output weights obtained via convex optimization, enabling rapid\ntraining and inference. Both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks are\nexplored.\n  In supervised learning, ELM is employed to learn parametric option pricing\nfunctions, predict intraday stock returns, and complete implied volatility\nsurfaces. Compared with deep neural networks, Gaussian process regression, and\nlogistic regression, ELM achieves higher computational speed, comparable\naccuracy, and superior generalization.\n  In unsupervised learning, ELM numerically solves Black-Scholes-type PDEs, and\noutperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks in training speed without losing\nprecision. The approximation and generalization abilities of ELM are briefly\ndiscussed.\n  The findings establish ELM as a practical and efficient tool for various\ntasks in quantitative finance.",
