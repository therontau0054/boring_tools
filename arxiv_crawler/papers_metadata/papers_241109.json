In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all\ntopological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete\nclassification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable\nanyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results\non solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with\nirrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic\nanyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an\nAFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological\nphase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition,\nwe introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU\nimplementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and\nsymmetry twist defects in solvable anyon theories. We apply our procedure to\nthe quantum double of the group $S_3$ and to several examples that are beyond\nsolvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$\nTambara-Yamagami string-net, and doubled $SU(2)_4$ anyons.",

            "summary": "The ability to predict future outcomes given control actions is fundamental\nfor physical reasoning. However, such predictive models, often called world\nmodels, have proven challenging to learn and are typically developed for\ntask-specific solutions with online policy learning. We argue that the true\npotential of world models lies in their ability to reason and plan across\ndiverse problems using only passive data. Concretely, we require world models\nto have the following three properties: 1) be trainable on offline,\npre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3)\nfacilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To realize this, we present DINO World\nModel (DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing\nthe visual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with\nDINOv2, enabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting\nfuture patch features. This design allows DINO-WM to achieve observational\ngoals through action sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic behavior\nplanning by treating desired goal patch features as prediction targets. We\nevaluate DINO-WM across various domains, including maze navigation, tabletop\npushing, and particle manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that DINO-WM\ncan generate zero-shot behavioral solutions at test time without relying on\nexpert demonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models. Notably,\nDINO-WM exhibits strong generalization capabilities compared to prior\nstate-of-the-art work, adapting to diverse task families such as arbitrarily\nconfigured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and\nmulti-particle scenarios.",

This\ntutorial article is an introduction to the collective dynamical evolution of\nthe very large numbers of stars and/or other self-gravitating objects that\ncomprise such systems, i.e. their kinetic theory.\n  We begin by introducing the basic phenomenology of stellar systems, and\nexplaining why and when we must develop a kinetic theory that transcends the\ntraditional two-body relaxation picture of Chandrasekhar. We study the orbits\nthat comprise stellar systems, how those orbits are modified by perturbations,\nhow a system responds self-consistently to fluctuations in its gravitational\npotential, and how one can predict the long term fate of a stellar system in\nvarious dynamical regimes. Though our treatment is necessarily mathematical, we\ndevelop the formalism only to the extent that it facilitates real calculations.\nWe give many examples throughout the text of the equations being applied to\ntopics of major astrophysical importance.\n  Furthermore, in the 1960s and 1970s the kinetic theory of stellar systems was\na fledgling subject which developed in tandem with the kinetic theory of\nplasmas. However, the two fields have long since diverged. Yet once one has\nbecome fluent in both Plasmaish and Galacticese, and has a dictionary relating\nthe two, one can pull ideas directly from one field to solve a problem in the\nother. Therefore, another aim of this tutorial article is to provide our plasma\ncolleagues with a jargon-light understanding of the key properties of stellar\nsystems, to point out the many direct analogies between stellar- and\nplasma-kinetic calculations, and ultimately to convince them that stellar\ndynamics and plasma kinetics are, in a deep and beautiful and useful sense, the\nsame thing.",

A temperature gradient oriented along a mean\nmagnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability\n(HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding\ntheir flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat\nflux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These\nnumerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large\nfluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at\nastrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell\nsimulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient\nlength scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in\nall of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling,\nsupporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to\ndevelop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision\noperator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the\nstandard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the\nwell-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community.

It was\nproposed initially based on the assumption that the oxygen vacancy defects\n(V$_\\text{O}$) in SiO$_\\text{2}$ dielectric layer are bistable in the Si-dimer\nand back-projected structures during carrier capture and emission. Through\nhigh-throughput first-principles structural search, we found V$_\\text{O}$ on\nnon-equivalent O sites in amorphous SiO$_\\text{2}$ can take 4 types of\nstructural configurations in neutral state and 7 types of configurations in +1\ncharged state after capturing holes, which produce a wide range of charge-state\ntransition levels for trapping holes. The finding contrasts the\nstructural-bistability assumption and makes the four-state model invalid for\nmost of O sites. To describe the reliability physics accurately, we propose an\nall-state model to consider all these structural configurations as well as all\nthe carrier capture/emission transitions and thermal transitions between them.\nWith the all-state model, we show that the V$_\\text{O}$ defects play important\nroles in causing NBTI, which challenges the recent studies that discarded\nV$_\\text{O}$ as a possible hole trap in NBTI.

However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more\nmemory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for\ndeployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers\nbetween weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a\nlow-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from\nactivations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in\nthe weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases\nthe quantization on both sides. However, na\\\"{\\i}vely running the low-rank\nbranch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of\nactivations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design\nan inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into\nthose of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also\nseamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for\nre-quantization.
