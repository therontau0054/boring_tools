Current machine learning approaches\nuse expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their\nability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as\nhigh-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we\naddress TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from\nstochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained\ngenerative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under\nthese dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to\nminimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to\nrepurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in\ncontrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We\ndemonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse,\nphysically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the\npre-trained model's original training dataset.

            "summary": "Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid\nphysiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and\nfunction. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for\nfunctional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging\nenables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial\nalternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,\nECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine\nMRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,\nparticularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel\nouter volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating\naliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.\nOur approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using\ncomposite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which\ninherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)\nmodel is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean\nouter volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding\nk-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL\n(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high\nspatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable\nto clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction\ntechniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach\nprovides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine\nMRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher\nacceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.",

These results should hold\nfor sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.\n  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a\nrandom matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem\nfor the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix\nmodels. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is\nsupported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect\nto time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE\nperspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE\\ satisfied by the log\npotential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally\nconverges to the desired PDE as $N\\rightarrow \\infty.$ We also present a\n\"multiplicative\" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.\n  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the\nholomorphic moments.",

The latter is strongly\naffected by surface active agents that are present in many applications.\nSurfactants lead to local changes in the interfacial tension, which influence\nthe mass transfer rates in two different ways. On the one hand, inhomogeneous\ninterfacial tension leads to Marangoni stress, which can strongly change the\nlocal hydrodynamics. One the other hand, the coverage by surfactant molecules\nresults in a mass transfer resistance. This hindrance effect is not included in\ncurrent continuum physical models. The present work provides the experimental\nvalidation of a recently introduced extended sharp-interface model for\ntwo-phase flows with mass transfer that also accounts for the mass transfer\nhindrance due to adsorbed surfactant. The crucial feature is to account for\narea-specific concentrations not only of adsorbed constituents but also of\ntransfer species, and to model mass transfer as a series of two bi-directional\nsorption-type bulk-interface exchange processes. The resulting model is shown\nto quantitatively describe experimental measurements on mass transfer reduction\nfor the dissolution of CO$_2$ bubbles in different surfactant solutions.",
