            "summary": "This work introduces a method for correcting the output distribution of a\nquantum computer that does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more\nphysical qubits. Thus, it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum\nerror correction codes. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel\n(we can bias the noise with twirling), the ideal output distribution and noisy\ndistribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove\nthat this matrix has a circulant block structure. Thus, the ideal distribution\ncan be retrieved from the noisy output distribution by applying the Fast\nFourier Transform. Moreover, due to its circulant structure, characterization\nof this matrix can be achieved by sampling a single circuit. The results are\ncorroborated with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and\n30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum\nphase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits.\nThe correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output\ndistributions. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution\nfidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.",

            "summary": "''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a\nunique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary\nstructure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent\nprogress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are\ninterpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these\nconcepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero\npairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for\nthe study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework,\nwe prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been\nproved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in\ndetail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.",

Using a known proof of\nspatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between\nboson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without\nthe use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a\nthermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the \"imaginary time\", to map\nclassical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through\nthe theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena,\nsuch as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and\ncontextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring\npolymer threads in thermal-space.

We find that $\\sigma$ and $\\kappa_\\mathrm{e}$ are inversely\nrelated, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and $\\sigma_\\mathrm{Q}$\nconverges to $\\approx (4\\pm 1)\\times e^2/h$ for multiple devices, where $e$ and\n$h$ are the electronic charge and the Planck's constant, respectively.

After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the\nquasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes\nin power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous\ntransitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that\nthe conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves\nthe irreversible nature in the relative motion of the original model and thus\nshows more accurate results than the analysis using the quasilinear response\nrelations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the\nconceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual model\nroughly preserves the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous\ntransitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.",
