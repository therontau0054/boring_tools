            "summary": "Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a\nfundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of\nlattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently\nis critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously\ndeveloped hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore\nquantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized\nquantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging\namplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the\ngenerative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation\nwithin the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and\ncompensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient\ndensity estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources\nrequired compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a\nrepresentative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our\nfocus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through\nquantum components. This work contributes toward the development of\nquantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling\nbottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.",

Recently, a different type of exotic\nparticle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called\nparastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological\nphases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still\nremains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of\nparastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using\nphysical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the\ntwo participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by\nexploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The\nwinning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well\nas the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This\nprovides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for\nparaparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.",

It is therefore useful to study\nphysical processes which generate entanglement within a large system, as they\nmaybe replicated for applications involving the said requirements in quantum\ninformation processing. A possible avenue to maximize entanglement generation\nis to rely on the phenomena of information scrambling, i.e. transport of\ninitially localized information throughout the system. Here the rationale is\nthat the spread of information carries with it an inherent capacity of\nentanglement generation. Scrambling greatly depends upon the dynamical nature\nof the system Hamiltonian, and the interplay between entanglement generation\nand information scrambling maybe investigated taking a chain of interacting\nspins on a one dimensional lattice. This system is analogous to an array of\nqubits and this relative simplicity implies that the resulting unitary dynamics\ncan be efficiently simulated using present-day cloud based NISQ devices. In our\npresent work, we consider such a spin model which is made up of nearest and\nnext nearest neighbor XXZ Model, along with an introduced coupling term lambda.\nThis coupling term serves as a tuning parameter which modifies the dynamical\nnature of the system from the integrable to the quantum chaotic regime. In\norder to quantify the entanglement generated within the system we use the more\ngeneral multipartite metric which computes the average entanglement across all\nsystem bipartitions to obtain a global picture of the entanglement structure\nwithin the entire system.",

This non-equilibrium is beyond classical fluid models,\noften requiring computationally-intensive kinetic simulations. In our work, we\nstudy high-order moment models in order to capture the non-equilibrium state\nwith a macroscopic set of equations, which is more computationally efficient\nthan kinetic simulations. We compare numerical simulations of different moment\nclosures: Grad's closure, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM),\nthe extended quadrature method of moments, and a method based on entropy\nmaximization. We assess the different closures for plasma applications and\npropose efficient numerical discretizations. The numerical solution of the\nhigh-order moment models is compared to kinetic simulations of an argon plasma\nbetween two floating walls at different pressure regimes, from nearly\ncollisionless to collisionally-dominated. In general, all the high-order moment\nclosures capture the ion transport with high fidelity as compared to the\nkinetic simulations, providing an improvement as compared to classical fluid\nmodels. Classical fluid closures such as the Fourier law for the heat flux is\nshown to be not suitable to capture the sheath or the low pressure regime. In\naddition, the ability of each moment method to reconstruct the velocity\ndistribution function from the moments is assessed. The high-order moment\nmodels are able to capture the non-equilibrium distributions in the bulk and\nsheath with remarkable fidelity, dramatically improving classical fluid models\nwhile having comparable computational cost.

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute\nmatters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the\nclassification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in\ntraining datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using\npurely feasible or infeasible datasets.",

However, the\nsub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion\npolicies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.\nWhile reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising\nsolution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to\neffectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This\nchallenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood\nestimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated\noptimization objectives.
