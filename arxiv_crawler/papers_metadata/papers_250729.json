We focus on the case of the Ising\nmodel under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase\nemerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and\n(low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier\nduality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a\nfinite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to\ncharacterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary\nconditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by\nboundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. By developing a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension\nof the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide\nnumerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their\ncorresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete\nphase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous)\nintermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate\ntransition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.",

We\npropose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in\nrelativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion\non a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts\nwith the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to\ntransporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across\nthe light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the\ncorresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our\nprescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk\nextremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with\nthe smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement\nthis prescription for holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on\nboth a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski\nspace, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical\nproperties of temporal entanglement.",

A new perspective is\npresented by analyzing the interplay between kinetic energy, mixing energy, and\nviscous dissipation using the temporal evolution of the total energy\nfunctional. The classical surface energy is approximated with mixing energy\nunder specific conditions, and the accuracy of this substitution is rigorously\nevaluated. The energy-based surface tension formulation derived from the\nKorteweg stress tensor demonstrates exceptional accuracy in capturing\nvariations in the mixing energy. These concepts are demonstrated by considering\ntwo benchmark problems: droplet oscillation and capillary thread breakup.

In this study, we\nconsider the opposite scenario and use muons produced in the forward direction\nto produce new muonphilic scalars, which can then be searched for at the FASER\ndetector. To minimize the backgrounds for this search, we make use of an\nupgraded preshower component, which is expected to be installed at FASER before\nthe end of Run 3, and is capable of spatially resolving two energetic photons.\nWe find that FASER, and its upgrade, FASER2 can probe currently unconstrained\nregions of parameter space, including regions that can potentially explain the\n$(g-2)_{\\mu}$ anomaly.

In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional,\nextrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not\nprivate since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side\ninformation held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement\noutcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing\nprobability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input\nstates.

Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been\nsteadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology.\nIn numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought'\nonly after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local\nhorizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing\npowerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs.\nThey also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen\ninsights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result\nthat their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in\nthe area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical\nprocesses at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting\ncorrelations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those\ndefined at future null infinity.

Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes.
