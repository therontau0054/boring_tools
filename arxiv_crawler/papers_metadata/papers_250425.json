            "summary": "When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does\nnot obey $U^{\\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not\nlost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different\nform. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due\nto $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must\nexist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\\dagger}$, so that\n$V^{-1}U^{\\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with\ndecay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation.\nThus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from\nthe excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all.",

However, its application has been limited in the study of\nvapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid\ndynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental\ndifficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to\nstudying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise\ncondensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic\ntwo-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and\ndeparture, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and\nnanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature\nmeasurements with both spatial (12 $\\mu$m) and temporal (5 ms) precision,\nleading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using\nconventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to\ndroplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local\ncondensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local\nthermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map\nvisual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical\nparameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional\nparameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local\ntemperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by\ndeveloping a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local\nthermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.",

However,\ninherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and\narchitectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real\ndata. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel\nframework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and\nstrong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an\nideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that\nalternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we\ntheoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling\ntrajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly\nflexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the\nstrategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5,\ngood experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nW2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt\nadherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image,\nvideo), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For\nexample, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to\n90% over the original results.
