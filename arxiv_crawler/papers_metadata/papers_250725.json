            "summary": "The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is\ncrucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with\nhumans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the\nincreased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained\ndynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a\nwide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and\nconstraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent\nactions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two\ntasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities\nto adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address\nthe challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS\n(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of\nagents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show\nthat BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI\ncollaboration.

In this work, we analyze the strong CP\nphase in QCD from the Hamiltonian perspective, focusing on the invariance of\nthe Hamiltonian H under P (or a generalized parity operator $\\mathcal{P}$). For\n$\\mathcal{P}$ to be a physical symmetry, it must preserve the Hilbert space\n$\\mathcal{H}_\\theta$ associated with the $\\theta$-vacuum (i.e., $\\mathcal{P}:\n\\mathcal{H}_\\theta \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}_\\theta$). This requirement implies\nthat the strong CP phase $\\bar{\\theta} = \\theta + \\arg \\det M$ must vanish,\ni.e., $\\theta$ must cancel the phase of the quark mass matrix $M$.\nEquivalently, we show that this condition follows from requiring that parity\ncommute with the large gauge transformation operator of QCD.",

            "summary": "Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are\ninvestigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case\nof Poincar\\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge\nfield theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle\nphysics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees\nof freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific\nparameter values, it reduces to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural\nextension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two\nparameters beyond those in $\\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion\nscalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing\nthe dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord`\nnested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified\nversion of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred\nHubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension\nanalysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical\ntension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this\nimprovement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\\Lambda$CDM in a\nBayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of\ngravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and\nmotivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a\ncosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid,\nRoman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory\n-- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of\ngravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring\nextended theories of gravity.",

They argue that, once the analytical expression of the DE is\nchosen, only one kind of BC's may emerge (e.g., Neumann rather than Dirichlet).\nIn this paper, we show that this case is very peculiar. Indeed, DE's generally\narise as long-wavelength limit out of a stochastic picture of microscopic\ndynamics, in the form of an integro-differential Master Equation (ME).\nAccordingly, they are justified only on a statistical basis, provide accurate\npictures of the system's evolution only over large enough length and time\nscales.

            "summary": "The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and\nphysical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical\nevaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in\nthe number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The\nproblem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte\nCarlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum\nalgorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of\nmatrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational\ncomplexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm\ncompresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an\nunentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term\nin the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small\ncontributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral\ndecimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable\nand integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral\ndecimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of\nnoninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the\nabsolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function\nof temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced\ndensity matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each\ncoupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to\nthese models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When\nconventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful\nalternative.",
