            "summary": "This study critically examines the performance of physics-informed machine\nlearning (PIML) approaches for traffic flow modeling, defining the failure of a\nPIML model as the scenario where it underperforms both its purely data-driven\nand purely physics-based counterparts. We analyze the loss landscape by\nperturbing trained models along the principal eigenvectors of the Hessian\nmatrix and evaluating corresponding loss values. Our results suggest that\nphysics residuals in PIML do not inherently hinder optimization, contrary to a\ncommonly assumed failure cause. Instead, successful parameter updates require\nboth ML and physics gradients to form acute angles with the quasi-true gradient\nand lie within a conical region. Given inaccuracies in both the physics models\nand the training data, satisfying this condition is often difficult.\nExperiments reveal that physical residuals can degrade the performance of LWR-\nand ARZ-based PIML models, especially under highly physics-driven settings.\nMoreover, sparse sampling and the use of temporally averaged traffic data can\nproduce misleadingly small physics residuals that fail to capture actual\nphysical dynamics, contributing to model failure. We also identify the\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition as a key indicator of dataset\nsuitability for PIML, where successful applications consistently adhere to this\ncriterion. Lastly, we observe that higher-order models like ARZ tend to have\nlarger error lower bounds than lower-order models like LWR, which is consistent\nwith the experimental findings of existing studies.",

In this work we reveal the universal property\nunderlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\\mathcal V$ which is\nstrongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical\napplications one takes $\\mathcal V=\\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector\nspaces. Given a $\\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\\mathcal C$ (not\nnecessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\\mathbb X\n\\mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established\nthe relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category\n$\\mathbb X \\mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\\mathcal C)$: $Z(\\mathcal\nC)\\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{Fun}(\\mathbb X \\mathcal C^{\\mathrm{op}},\\mathcal\nV)\\cong Z(\\mathcal C\\hookrightarrow\\mathrm{Fun}(\\mathcal\nC^{\\mathrm{op}},\\mathcal V))\\hookrightarrow Z(\\mathrm{Fun}(\\mathcal\nC^{\\mathrm{op}},\\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as\na version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the \"Wick-rotated\"\nperspective, that the morphisms in $\\mathbb X \\mathcal C$ are the local tensors\nof fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\\mathcal\nC$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored\nconstruction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators\npreserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the\nsymmetry which form the Drinfeld center.
