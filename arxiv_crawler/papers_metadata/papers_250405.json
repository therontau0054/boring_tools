Cold-atom analog experiments will\nsoon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially\nfar-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics.\nHowever, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early\nUniverse is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of\nEuclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries\ngenerically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment,\nobscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate\nthat implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely\neliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our\nfindings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the\nlaboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.",

Throughout history of science, we have\nwitnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or\nfalsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking,\nbut the space of survived theories become more constrained with more\nexperimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI\nscientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI\nscientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes\nthey form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To\nmechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their\nagreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI\nScientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training\nresults across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI\nscientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a\nHamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more\ncomplex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the\ntraining dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of\nrelevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks\naid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.",

After over a\ndecade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino\nevents such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous\nconfirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its\nexperimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the\nStandard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow\nresonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This\narticle suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely,\nthat the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator\nenergies, occurring as $e^+e^-\\rightarrow W^-\\rho(770)^+$. Although the\nresonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent,\nquite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\\rho^+$ from the\ninitial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\\bar\\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP\nconjugate channel, $\\nu_e e^+\\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form\n$e^+e^-\\rightarrow W^+\\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons are also\npossible.

Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in\n[M.-O. Renou et al, Nature 600, 625-629, 2021], a decisive argument was\npresented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers\nis indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation\nlocality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to\nthe states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We\nobserve that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was\nderived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By\nstarting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive\na combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties\nanalogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that\nthe conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and\nrepresentation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the\nstate space.

Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary.

However, scaling imitation learning for large robot\nfoundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality\nexpert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide\nrange of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data\nprovides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and\nagent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation\nlearning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation\nrequired for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World\nModels (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data\nfor policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process\nand a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where\nindependent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply\ncontrolling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a\nforward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated\nand real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining\non large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action\npredictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation\nlearning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data\nthrough independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further\nimproving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM\noffers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for\nscalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often\ndisparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

To address this issue, we construct noisy\nsamples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and\nmaintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception\nfield that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum\nrestricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions.\nTherefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a\npixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better\nrecovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion\nmodels to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further\nfinetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render\nnew frames for momentum update in the next step.
