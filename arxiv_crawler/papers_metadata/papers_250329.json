            "summary": "Non-Markovian dynamics go beyond the Markovian approximation by capturing\nmemory effects and information backflow in open quantum systems, which are\ncrucial for describing realistic physical processes. In this work, we study the\nexact non-Markovian dynamics of a driven cavity coupled to an anisotropic\nthree-dimensional photonic-crystal environment via counterrotating-wave\ninteractions. We derive an exact analytical expression for the cavity amplitude\nsatisfying the integro-differential equation, which includes the contributions\nof the bound states outside the continuum and the dissipative parts with the\ncontinuum spectrum. Based on the characteristic function method, we derive the\nexact non-Markovian master equation for the cavity, which contributes to the\ngain of the cavity. We give the physical origin of non-Markovian gain in the\npresence of bound states in the system consisting of cavity and environment,\nwhich has no Markovian counterparts due to the nonexponential gain in the\nnon-Markovian structured environment. We find that three different types of\nbound states can be formed in the system, containing one bound state with no\ninversion of photon number, two bound states with the periodic equal-amplitude\noscillation, and the gain with two complex roots without the bound states\nformation. We derive a current equation including the source from the driving\nfield, the transient current induced by the change in the number of photons,\nand the two-photon current caused by the counterrotating-wave term. The results\nare compared with those given by the rotating-wave interactions and extended to\na more general quantum network involving an arbitrary number of coupled\ncavities. Our findings may pave the way for a deeper understanding of\nnon-Markovian dynamics with gain in quantum networks involving\ncounterrotating-wave effects.",

This approach is especially useful in healthcare,\nas it enables training on sensitive data without needing to share them. The\nnature of federated learning necessitates robust security precautions due to\ndata leakage concerns during communication. To address this issue, we propose a\nnew approach that employs selective encryption, homomorphic encryption,\ndifferential privacy, and bit-wise scrambling to minimize data leakage while\nachieving good execution performance. Our technique , FAS (fast and secure\nfederated learning) is used to train deep learning models on medical imaging\ndata. We implemented our technique using the Flower framework and compared with\na state-of-the-art federated learning approach that also uses selective\nhomomorphic encryption. Our experiments were run in a cluster of eleven\nphysical machines to create a real-world federated learning scenario on\ndifferent datasets. We observed that our approach is up to 90\\% faster than\napplying fully homomorphic encryption on the model weights. In addition, we can\navoid the pretraining step that is required by our competitor and can save up\nto 46% in terms of total execution time. While our approach was faster, it\nobtained similar security results as the competitor.",

Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure\nby combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a\nlogarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This\nintegrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free\nenergy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied\nwith the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases\nin which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are\nencountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained\nfrom the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full\ncharacterization of the rare event under study.

This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper.

In light\nof the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the\nphysics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and\nthe conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel\napproximations for $1/\\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series\nmotivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators\nto find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the\nparametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed\nfor string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in\nthe new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire\ncontribution to $1/\\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting\nat a universal property of LCFTs.

These models are supposed to\nprovide consistent results since they are derived from the same Hamiltonian.\nWhile we confirm that the local model is a proper $\\textbf{q}\\to\\textbf{0}$\nlimit of both the non-local Kubo and the non-local QFT model (once losses are\nadded to this last model), we find hard inconsistencies in the non-local QFT\nmodel as derived and currently used in literature. In particular, in the\ngenuine non-local region ($\\textbf{q}\\neq\\textbf{0}$), the available QFT model\nshows an intrinsic non-physical plasma-like behavior for the interband\ntransversal electric conductivity at low frequencies (even after introducing\nthe unavoidable losses). The Kubo model, instead, shows the expected behavior,\ni.e., an almost constant electric conductivity as a function of frequency\n$\\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\\hbar\\omega<\\sqrt{(\\hbar v_F\nq)^{2}+4m^{2}}$. We show that the Kubo and QFT models can be expressed using an\nidentical Polarization operator $\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}(\\omega,\\textbf{q})$, but they\nemploy different expressions for the electric conductivity\n$\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}(\\omega,\\textbf{q})$. In particular, the Kubo model uses a\nstandard regularized expression, a direct consequence of Ohm's Law and\ncausality, as we rigorously re-derive. We show that, once the standard\nregularized expression for $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}(\\omega,\\textbf{q})$ is used in the\nQFT model, and losses are included, the Kubo and QFT model coincide, and all\nits anomalies naturally disappear.

            "summary": "For three decades, optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been synonymous\nwith phase vortices. Here, our research challenges this paradigm by\ndemonstrating a vortex-free intrinsic OAM arising from three-dimensional\ncaustic trajectories in structured light fields, distinct from traditional\nvortex-based mechanisms. Optical OAM was traditionally considered rare,\npredominantly manifesting during high-order atomic and molecular transitions.\nThe conceptual shift initiated by Allen et al. in 1992, which showed that laser\nbeams with optical vortex--characterized by their twisted wavefronts--naturally\ncarry intrinsic OAM, laid the groundwork for subsequent studies. However, the\nexploration of intrinsic OAM in vortex-free laser modes remains a largely\nuntapped area. Addressing this gap, our research proposes a third category of\noptical intrinsic angular momentum--termed \"vortex-free OAM\"--that complements\nspin angular momentum (SAM) in circularly polarized beams and OAM in vortex\nbeams. This new form of OAM is governed by a hydrodynamic analogy between light\npropagation and fluid dynamics, linking the orbital motion of energy\nstreamlines to quantifiable angular momentum. Through numerical simulations,\nexperimental measurements, and investigations of the mechanical transfer of OAM\nto trapped particles using optical tweezers, we establish vortex-free OAM as a\nuniversal property of structured fields with three-dimensional caustic\ntrajectories. Furthermore, we propose a unified hydrodynamic framework that\ntranscends traditional wavefront-centric models, facilitating the\ngeneralization of OAM analysis to both vortex and vortex-free regimes. This\nframework not only enhances our understanding of the physical origin of optical\nangular momentum but also unlocks new opportunities in optical manipulation,\nclassical and quantum communications, and light-matter interaction\ntechnologies.",

While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/theEricMa/TriplaneTurbo.",

            "summary": "Quantitative investment (quant) is an emerging, technology-driven approach in\nasset management, increasingy shaped by advancements in artificial\nintelligence. Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs)\nfor quant finance have improved predictive modeling and enabled agent-based\nautomation, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in this field. In this\nsurvey, taking alpha strategy as a representative example, we explore how AI\ncontributes to the quantitative investment pipeline. We first examine the early\nstage of quant research, centered on human-crafted features and traditional\nstatistical models with an established alpha pipeline. We then discuss the rise\nof deep learning, which enabled scalable modeling across the entire pipeline\nfrom data processing to order execution. Building on this, we highlight the\nemerging role of LLMs in extending AI beyond prediction, empowering autonomous\nagents to process unstructured data, generate alphas, and support\nself-iterative workflows.",
