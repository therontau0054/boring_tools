The nuclear matter phase is described within a\nrelativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition\nis obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the\ntwo-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the\nscalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell\nconstruction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star\nis not smaller than 2.0 M$_\\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase\ntransition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$.\nThe result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of\nstate has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark\nmatter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 -\n2.22~M_\\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\\odot$, the radii of\nthese stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In\nprinciple, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by\nthe hadronic reference equation of state.",

            "summary": "Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural\nprediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features\nin the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a\nunique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived\nfrom Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial\nfluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial\nfeatures would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they\nare expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated\nN-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while\noscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of\nprimordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure\nformation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in\nthe matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be\nused to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern\nin the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for\nconstraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the\nchallenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes\nrelevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark\nmatter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary\nphysics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need\nfor refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.",

In this work, we construct a\nmap between the two families of hypersurfaces and interpret the corresponding\noperators as superluminal velocity boosts. Though a physical observer cannot\n`jump' the light speed barrier, to pass from one regime to the other (at least\nnot classically), the existence of superluminal motion does not, by itself,\ngenerate paradoxes. The implications of this construction for recent work on\nthe `quantum principle of relativity', proposed by Dragan and Ekert, are\ndiscussed. The geometric picture reproduces their `superboost' operator in\n$(1+1)$ dimensions but generalises to $(1+3)$ dimensions in a very different\nway. This leaves open an important possibility, which appears to be closed to\nexisting models, namely, the possibility of embedding the superluminal boosts\nwithin a group structure, without generating additional unwanted phenomenology,\nthat contradicts existing experimental results. We prove that the set\ncontaining both subluminal and superluminal boosts forms a group, in\n$(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes, and outline a program to extend these results\nto higher-dimensional geometries.",

By analyzing the mass spectrum and mixing angles of these VLLs\nwith the SM leptons, we identify conditions under which the Higgs potential\nremains stable.

We\nintroduce an efficient tensorial method to update the nonlinear term using a\nprecomputed third-order tensor. We capture multiscale behavior with a minimal\nnumber of POD modes by decomposing the solution manifold into multiple time\nwindows and creating temporally local ROMs. We consider two strategies for\ndecomposition: one based on the physical time and the other based on the\nelectric field energy. Applied to the 1D1V Vlasov-Poisson simulations, that is,\nprescribed E-field, Landau damping, and two-stream instability, we demonstrate\nthat our ROMs accurately capture the total energy of the system both for\nparametric and time extrapolation cases. The temporally local ROMs are more\nefficient and accurate than the single ROM.
