            "summary": "In drug discovery, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein-ligand\nbinding provides a powerful tool for predicting binding affinities, estimating\ntransport properties, and exploring pocket sites. There has been a long history\nof improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods\nand, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges\nremain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address\nthis issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate\nnumerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding\ndynamics. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel\nphysics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we\npropose (1) the BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector\nframes and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an\naugmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under\nNewtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and\nthree multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency\nand effectiveness of NeuralMD, achieving over 1K$\\times$ speedup compared to\nstandard numerical MD simulations. NeuralMD also outperforms all other ML\napproaches, achieving up to 15$\\times$ reduction in reconstruction error and\n70% increase in validity. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate that the\noscillations in the predicted trajectories align more closely with ground-truth\ndynamics than those of other machine-learning methods. We believe NeuralMD\npaves the foundation for a new research paradigm in simulating protein-ligand\ndynamics.",

            "summary": "Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient\napproach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local\nnonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework\nprovides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and\ntopological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its\ntopology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative\nenvironments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework\nenables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological\nprotection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the\nspectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras,\nand not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires\ndeveloping intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than\nthose that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology.\nIn this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a\nground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for\nunderstanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of\ntopological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the\nframework's application to a variety of topological classes, including\ncrystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can\nbe reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework,\nincluding the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this\nintroduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator\npseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that\nform the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.",

            "summary": "Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are\ninstrumental for studying sub-atomic dynamics, and are often produced from a\nfree electron laser (FEL) by electron microbunches in an undulator. An\noptical-FEL (OFEL) utilizes a counter-propagating laser pulse instead of an\nundulator, and has been proposed as a more compact and tunable source than a\nFEL. Yet, an OFEL is difficult to realize because of the high electron density\nrequired and subsequent high emittance. We demonstrate that broadband coherent\nXUV light, which in the temporal domain corresponds to a train of attosecond\npulses with 8-as duration at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching\nof relativistic electrons and positrons in an optical laser pulse. The symmetry\nbetween electrons and positrons in the bunch stabilizes the system and enables\nthe rapid formation of dense microbunches over a ten-micrometer distance\ninstead of the tens of meters typically required in an undulator. The high\nmicrobunch density and the stable spectral phase up to emitted photon energies\nof about 350 eV, allow for the creation of orders of magnitude more compact\nsources of XUV light that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and\nindustry.",

            "summary": "Hydrogen combustion systems operated under fuel-lean conditions offer great\npotential for low emissions. However, these operating conditions are also\nsusceptible to intrinsic thermodiffusive combustion instabilities. Even though\ntechnical combustors are enclosed by walls that significantly influence the\ncombustion process, intrinsic flame instabilities have mostly been investigated\nin canonical freely-propagating flame configurations unconfined by walls. This\nstudy aims to close this gap by investigating the flame-wall interaction of\nthermodiffusive unstable hydrogen/air flame through detailed numerical\nsimulations in a two-dimensional head-on quenching configuration. It presents\nan in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of the quenching process,\nrevealing the major impact factors of the instabilities on the quenching\ncharacteristics. The thermodiffusive instabilities result in lower quenching\ndistances and increased wall heat fluxes compared to one-dimensional head-on\nquenching flames under similar operation conditions. The change in quenching\ncharacteristics seems not to be driven by kinematic effects. Instead, the\nincreased wall heat fluxes are caused by the enhanced flame reactivity of the\nunstable flame approaching the wall, which results from mixture variations\nassociated with the instabilities. Overall, the study highlights the importance\nof studying flame-wall interaction in more complex domains than simple\none-dimensional configurations, where such instabilities are inherently\nsuppressed. Further, it emphasizes the need to incorporate local mixture\nvariations induced by intrinsic combustion instabilities in combustion models\nfor flame-wall interactions. In part II of this study, the scope is expanded to\ngas turbine and internal combustion engine relevant conditions through a\nparametric study, varying the equivalence ratio, pressure, and unburnt\ntemperature.",

However, the efficient treatment\ndelivery of ARC is challenging due to the required frequent energy changes\nduring the continuous gantry rotation. This work proposes a novel method that\ndelivers a multiple IMPT (multi-IMPT) plan that is equivalent to ARC in terms\nof biologically effective dose (BED).\n  Approach: The proposed multi-IMPT method utilizes a different subset of\nlimited number of beam angles in each fraction for dose delivery. Due to the\ndifferent dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR) in each fraction, we optimize\nbiologically effective dose (BED) for OAR and the physical dose delivered for\ntarget in each fraction. The BED-based multi-IMPT inverse optimization problem\nis solved via the iterative convex relaxation method and the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-IMPT\nmethod is evaluated in terms of dose objectives in comparison with ARC.\n  Main results: Multi-IMPT provided similar plan quality with ARC. For example,\nmulti-IMPT provided better OAR sparing and slightly better target dose coverage\nfor the prostate case; similar dose distribution for the lung case; slightly\nworse dose coverage for the brain case; better dose coverage but slightly\nhigher BED in OAR for the head-and-neck case.\n  Significance: We have proposed a multi-IMPT approach to deliver\nARC-equivalent plan quality.\n  Keywords: biologically effective dose (BED), proton arc therapy",

The\ngeneral definition describes modes as quasi coherent when the magnitude squared\ncoherence is in the range of \\SIrange{0.3}{0.6}{}. Quasi coherent modes are\nobserved in the plasma core as well as in the plasma edge and can have quite\ndifferent physical origins. The one in the core are observed in plasmas with\nlow collisionality, where the electron temperature exceeds the ion temperature\nin the plasma core. This is the case for electron cyclotron heating in general.\nThe origin of these modes are electrons trapped within a magnetic mirror, as\nreported in the past from various fusion devices. The so-called\ntrapped-electron modes (TEMs) belong to drift wave instabilities and can be\ndestabilized by electron-temperature gradients in the plasma core. From the\ndiagnostic point of view, quasi coherent modes appear as fluctuations in\nelectron density and temperature. Therefore, the microwave reflectometer is\nvery well suited to monitor these modes. This paper describes experiments,\nconducted at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X), which aim at detecting\nquasi coherent modes at low wave numbers. A Poloidal Correlation Reflectometer\n(PCR) installed at W7-X, is able to measure low wave numbers ($k_\\perp\\le 3.5$\ncm$^{-1}$). For different magnetic configurations and plasma parameters, broad\nquasi-coherent structures are observed in the coherence spectra. From the\nanalysis of the rotation and the poloidal structure, these quasi coherent (QC)\nmodes show the properties of electron-temperature-gradient driven TEMs. A\nlinear relation between the mode velocity and the rotation frequency is found.\nThe relation is uniform and confirms the nature of QC-mode observation as TEM\nin tokamaks, too.",

            "summary": "Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision\nmodels that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a\ntokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to\nleverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However,\ntraining existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost\nas they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we\nintroduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from\ncoordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos,\ninspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok\nencodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs\npatches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows\nfor training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring\nexcessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can\ndrastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For\ninstance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\\times$128 resolution\ninto 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar\nreconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization\nenables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate\n128 frames at once.",
