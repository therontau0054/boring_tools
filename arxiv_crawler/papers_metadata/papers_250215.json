Since\nthe emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excess could be due to the $B^+$\ndecaying into a $K^+$ and a dark-matter pair. We entertain this possibility in\na two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a real singlet scalar boson acting\nas the dark matter. This model also accommodates strangeness-changing\ninteractions providing new sources of $CP$ violation which can affect hyperon\nand kaon nonleptonic transitions. We find that the resulting $CP$ violation in\nthe hyperon sector can be significant, reaching the current empirical bounds,\nafter taking into account constraints from kaon mixing and decay and from\ndark-matter relic-density data and direct searches including the Migdal effect.\nWe demonstrate that the hyperon and kaon processes are complementary probes of\nthis new-physics scenario. Its prediction for sizable hyperon $CP$ violation is\npotentially testable in ongoing experiments, such as BESIII, Belle II, and\nLHCb, and in next-generation ones like PANDA and at the Super Tau Charm\nFacility.",

These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model\nby introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To\ndevelop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include\nstrain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We\nfind that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order\nperturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space,\nand remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson\nmodel. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF\nHamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4\nsymmetry-breaking terms.

One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient\nreplacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in\nparallel during each diffusion step.

In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical\nanalysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked\nDiffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the\ntarget evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using\nperplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling\nsteps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be\nachieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence\nerror rate--which is important for understanding the \"correctness\" of a\nsequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps\nmust scale linearly with sequence length to obtain \"correct\" sequences, thereby\neliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models.

However, these traffic scenarios do not react when the\nmotion of agents deviates from their modelled trajectories. For example, the\nego-agent can be controlled by a stand along motion planner. To produce\nreactive scenarios with joint scenario models, the model must regenerate the\nscenario at each timestep based on new observations in a Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) fashion. Although reactive, this method is time-consuming, as one\ncomplete possible future for all NPCs is generated per simulation step.\nAlternatively, one can utilize an autoregressive model (AR) to predict only the\nimmediate next-step future for all NPCs. Although faster, this method lacks the\ncapability for advanced planning. We present a rolling diffusion based traffic\nscene generation model which mixes the benefits of both methods by predicting\nthe next step future and simultaneously predicting partially noised further\nfuture steps at the same time.
