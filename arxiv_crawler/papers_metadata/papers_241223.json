            "summary": "We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\\Lambda$CDM model and its\nextensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus\non neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine\ncombinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey\ndata, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we\nderive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\\Sigma m_\\nu$). Our results\nshow upper limits in the range of $\\Sigma m_\\nu < 76.9\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ to\n$\\Sigma m_\\nu < 108\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ (95\\% CL). The variation in the limits on\n$\\Sigma m_\\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the\nseparate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and\nits relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\\Sigma\nm_\\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\\Lambda$CDM, we find a\n$1.47\\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO),\nwith similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong\nconstraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at\n$1.36\\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the\nshape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\\Sigma m_\\nu > 0$, is only\npresent at less than $2\\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra\nrelativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\\rm eff} \\approx 3.5$, alleviate the\nHubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV\npartially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is\nincluded, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.\n[abridged]",

            "summary": "Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS\nturbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc\npostprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address\nthe realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes\nnon-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for\nrealizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework\nfor data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and\nconditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding\nequivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to\nenhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the\nconditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model\narchitecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills,\nand flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is\ndemonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions\nmade by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether,\nthe proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant\nanisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.\nWe make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as\npart of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear\nmappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising\nresults for the flat plate case.",

            "summary": "The design of soft robots is still commonly driven by manual trial-and-error\napproaches, requiring the manufacturing of multiple physical prototypes, which\nin the end, is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. To reduce the\nnumber of manual interventions in this process, topology optimization can be\nused to assist the design process. The design is then guided by simulations and\nnumerous prototypes can be tested in simulation rather than being evaluated\nthrough laborious experiments. To implement this simulation-driven design\nprocess, the possible design space of a slender soft pneumatic actuator is\ngeneralized to the design of the circular cross-section. We perform a black-box\ntopology optimization using genetic algorithms to obtain a cross-sectional\ndesign of a soft pneumatic actuator that is capable of reaching a target\nworkspace defined by the end-effector positions at different pressure values.\nThis design method is evaluated for three different case studies and target\nworkspaces, which were either randomly generated or specified by the operator\nof the design assistant. The black-box topology optimization based on genetic\nalgorithms proves to be capable of finding good designs under given plausible\ntarget workspaces. We considered a simplified simulation model to verify the\nefficacy of the employed method. An experimental validation has not yet been\nperformed. It can be concluded that the employed black-box topology\noptimization can assist in the design process for slender soft pneumatic\nactuators. It supports at searching for possible design prototypes that reach\npoints specified by corresponding actuation pressures. This helps reduce the\ntrial-and-error driven iterative manual design process and enables the operator\nto focus on prototypes that already offer a good viable solution.",

            "summary": "Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a promising tool for optimally targeted\ntreatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI), offering submillimeter precision to\nenhance blood flow at injury sites while minimizing impact on surrounding\ntissues. However, its efficacy is highly sensitive to the placement of the\nultrasound source, as the spinal cord's complex geometry and acoustic\nheterogeneity distort and attenuate the FUS signal. Current approaches rely on\ncomputer simulations to solve the governing wave propagation equations and\ncompute patient-specific pressure maps using ultrasound images of the spinal\ncord anatomy. While accurate, these high-fidelity simulations are\ncomputationally intensive, taking up to hours to complete parameter sweeps,\nwhich is impractical for real-time surgical decision-making. To address this\nbottleneck, we propose a convolutional deep operator network (DeepONet) to\nrapidly predict FUS pressure fields in patient spinal cords. Unlike\nconventional neural networks, DeepONets are well equipped to approximate the\nsolution operator of the parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that\ngovern the behavior of FUS waves with varying initial and boundary conditions\n(i.e., new transducer locations or spinal cord geometries) without requiring\nextensive simulations. Trained on simulated pressure maps across diverse\npatient anatomies, this surrogate model achieves real-time predictions with\nonly a 2% loss on the test set, significantly accelerating the modeling of\nnonlinear physical systems in heterogeneous domains. By facilitating rapid\nparameter sweeps in surgical settings, this work provides a crucial step toward\nprecise and individualized solutions in neurosurgical treatments.",

            "summary": "Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is\ncrucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations.\nHowever, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity,\nand interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding\nof their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face\nlimitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability,\nreducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a\nnovel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Time\nFusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex\npatterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using\ndimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN.\nThese visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and\ntailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal\npatterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential\ncorrelations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is\ndemonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it\nidentifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies\nwith diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are\nintroduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and\nconsistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different\nconfigurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter\ntuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT\nachieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data\nshapes compared to VAE.

            "summary": "In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect\nis used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface\nstate (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction\nmade on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the\nexistence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev\nmodes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a\nfunction of the superconducting phase difference $\\varphi$ across the junction.\nHere, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\\varphi =\n(2n+1)\\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of\nstates is probed via tunnel contacts and $\\varphi$ is controlled by a flux\nloop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials,\nsupporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field,\nJosephson vortices form, making $\\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the\ngap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\\varphi =\n(2n+1)\\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of\nspin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the\nobserved gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.",

At these energy scales, the Standard\nModel Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework provides an enhanced sensitivity\nto potential new physics effects. This motivates the inclusion of EW\ncorrections not only for SM predictions but also for analyses within SMEFT. In\nthis work, we compute EW corrections in the high-energy limit for a selected\nset of dimension-six operators, specifically the class of four-fermion contact\ninteractions, in key hard-scattering processes relevant to both current and\nfuture colliders: top-quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nand in a muon collider scenario, as well as the Drell-Yan process at the LHC.\nWe first discuss the technical details and challenges associated with\nevaluating EW Sudakov logarithms in SMEFT, contrasting them with the SM case.\nWe then present phenomenological results for the aforementioned processes,\nhighlighting the non-trivial effects introduced by EW corrections arising from\nthe insertion of dimension-six, four-fermion operators. Importantly, the\nresulting $K$-factors exhibit significant deviations from their SM\ncounterparts, with dependencies not only on the process but also on the\nspecific operators considered. Finally, we explore the potential to lift flat\ndirections in the SMEFT parameter space by incorporating higher-order\ncorrections, using Fisher information techniques.",

For the first part, we learn an in-filling diffusion model to\nhallucinate unseen parts of a person given a single image. We train this model\non texture map space, which makes it more sample-efficient since it is\ninvariant to pose and viewpoint.

In biomedical applications,\nit can provide quantitative information missing in label-free microscopy\nmodalities. One of the most prominent methods in phase quantification is the\nTransport-of-Intensity Equation (TIE). TIE often requires multiple acquisitions\nat different defocus distances, which is not always feasible in a clinical\nsetting. To address this issue, we propose to use chromatic aberrations to\ninduce the required through-focus images with a single exposure, effectively\ngenerating a through-focus stack. Since the defocus distance induced by the\naberrations is small, conventional TIE solvers are insufficient to address the\nresulting artifacts. We propose Zero-Mean Diffusion, a modified version of\ndiffusion models designed for quantitative image prediction, and train it with\nsynthetic data to ensure robust phase retrieval. Our contributions offer an\nalternative TIE approach that leverages chromatic aberrations, achieving\naccurate single-exposure phase measurement with white light and thus improving\nthe efficiency of phase imaging. Moreover, we present a new class of diffusion\nmodels that are well-suited for quantitative data and have a sound theoretical\nbasis. To validate our approach, we employ a widespread brightfield microscope\nequipped with a commercially available color camera. We apply our model to\nclinical microscopy of patients' urine, obtaining accurate phase measurements.",

            "summary": "We use modifications of the Adams method and very fast and accurate\nsinh-acceleration method of the Fourier inversion (iFT) (S.Boyarchenko and\nLevendorski\\u{i}, IJTAF 2019, v.22) to evaluate prices of vanilla options; for\noptions of moderate and long maturities and strikes not very far from the spot,\nthousands of prices can be calculated in several msec. with relative errors of\nthe order of 0.5\\% and smaller running Matlab on a Mac with moderate\ncharacteristics. We demonstrate that for the calibrated set of parameters in\nEuch and Rosenbaum, Math. Finance 2019, v. 29, the correct implied volatility\nsurface is significantly flatter and fits the data very poorly, hence, the\ncalibration results in op.cit. is an example of the {\\em ghost calibration}\n(M.Boyarchenko and Levendorki\\u{i}, Quantitative Finance 2015, v. 15): the\nerrors of the model and numerical method almost cancel one another. We explain\nhow calibration errors of this sort are generated by each of popular versions\nof numerical realizations of iFT (Carr-Madan, Lipton-Lewis and COS methods)\nwith prefixed parameters of a numerical method, resulting in spurious\nvolatility smiles and skews. We suggest a general {\\em Conformal Bootstrap\nprinciple} which allows one to avoid ghost calibration errors. We outline\nschemes of application of Conformal Bootstrap principle and the method of the\npaper to the design of accurate and fast calibration procedures.",
