The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored\nto capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a\n`small' parameter $\\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of\nidentical fermion copies (flavor number). When applied to three-dimensional\ninteracting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the\nAbelian monopole charge $n>1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation\n($N_b=2$), a leading order RG analysis suggests Gaussian nature of the\nunderlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume\nmean-field values. A traditional field theoretic RG analysis yields same\noutcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$).\nConsequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic\ncorrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.",

Current text-driven human avatar\ngeneration methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a\nunified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for\nsimulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in\nrepresenting the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging\nestablished prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g.,\nStable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural\nsimulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that\ncombines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and\ngarment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D\ngenerative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from\nthe given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion\nmodels, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair\nstrands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the\navatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the\ngarment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians\nthrough carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our\nsynthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic,\nfully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current\napproaches.",

            "summary": "PINN models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing fluid PDE\nproblems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This\nstudy identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid\nmechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the\nlimitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used\nin solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a)\nPINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with\nthe finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution\nspace utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the\ncomplex geometries often present in solid structures.\n  This work proposes a PINN architecture used for general solid mechanics\nproblems, termed the Finite-PINN model. The proposed model aims to effectively\naddress these two challenges while preserving as much of the original\nimplementation of PINN as possible. The unique architecture of the Finite-PINN\nmodel addresses these challenges by separating the approximation of stress and\ndisplacement fields, and by transforming the solution space from the\ntraditional Euclidean space to a Euclidean-topological joint space. Several\ncase studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the Finite-PINN model\nprovides satisfactory results for a variety of problem types, including both\nforward and inverse problems, in both 2D and 3D contexts.

Due\nto resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of\nthis information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows\nmodels to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective\nresolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not\nideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned\ncompression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality;\nthus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders\nreduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to\nsignificant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC\n(Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines\nlinear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders.\nWaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck\nbetween an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics,\nWaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion\nmodels.
