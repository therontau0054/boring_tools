            "summary": "Nordic skiing provides fascinating opportunities for mathematical modelling\nstudies that exploit methods and insights from physics, applied mathematics,\ndata analysis, scientific computing and sports science. A typical ski course\nwinds over varied terrain with frequent changes in elevation and direction, and\nso its geometry is naturally described by a three-dimensional space curve. The\nskier travels along a course under the influence of various forces, and their\ndynamics can be described using a nonlinear system of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) that are derived from Newton's laws of motion. We develop an\nalgorithm for solving the governing equations that combines Hermite spline\ninterpolation, numerical quadrature and a high-order ODE solver. Numerical\nsimulations are compared with measurements of skiers on actual courses to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Throughout, we aim to illustrate\nhow elementary concepts from undergraduate courses in calculus and scientific\ncomputing can be applied to study real problems in sport, which we hope will\nprovide stimulating examples for both instructors and students. At the same\ntime, we demonstrate how these concepts are capable of providing novel insights\ninto skiing that should also be of interest to sport scientists.",

            "summary": "Tropical East and West Pacific Oceans display differences in their vertical\nvelocity (or omega) profiles. The East Pacific is characterized by bottom-heavy\nprofiles, while the West Pacific is characterized by top-heavy profiles.\nAlthough inter-basin differences in the horizontal SST gradient are known to be\nimportant, physical reasons for why these omega structure variants exist are\nnot fully understood. This question is addressed using a steady, linear model\non an $f$-plane with $n$ atmospheric layers. Convection and radiation are\nparameterized as linear responses to thermodynamic perturbations with\nconvective nonlinearity approximated by convection on/off regimes. The free (or\neigen) modes of the model yield vertical structures resembling the observed\nbaroclinic modes of the tropical atmosphere, with each mode associated with a\ncharacteristic horizontal scale (the eigenvalue). In the standard parameter\nregime, the first-baroclinic mode has a large spatial scale ($\\sim$ 1500 km)\nwhile the second-baroclinic mode has a smaller spatial scale ($\\sim$ 250 km).\nWhen the model is forced with a strong- and weak-gradient surface temperature\n($T_s$) patterns, the resulting omega profiles assume bottom- and top-heavy\nstructures respectively -- mimicking the observed differences between East and\nWest Pacific Oceans. Additional dependence on the magnitude of the Coriolis\nforce is also observed. The connection between the vertical structure and the\nhorizontal scale of the baroclinic modes explains why a strong-gradient $T_s$\nprofile projects strongly onto the second-baroclinic mode yielding bottom-heavy\nomega profiles in the eastern Pacific, while a weak-gradient $T_s$ profile\nprojects strongly onto the first-baroclinic mode, yielding top-heavy omega\nprofiles typical of the Western Pacific.",

These pathways converge at a single structural point,\nenabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency\nrange over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct\nnumerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow\ninstability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the\ncharacteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using\na super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow,\nwe show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations\nacross a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable\nwith a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling\nbroadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a\nlongstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it\nintroduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction.\nThe ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges\nestablishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with\nfar-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and\nbeyond.",

This framework\ngives rise to regions of parameter space where DM is obtained via\nco-annihilation with nearby higgsino-like electroweakinos and DM direct\ndetection~signals are suppressed, the so-called ``blind spots\". On the other\nhand, collider signatures remain promising due to enhanced radiative decay\nmodes of higgsinos into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, rather than\ninto leptons or hadrons. This motivates searches for radiatively decaying\nneutralinos, however, these signals face substantial background challenges, as\nthe decay products are typically soft due to the small mass-splits ($\\Delta m$)\nbetween the LSP and the higgsino-like coannihilation partners. We apply a\ndata-driven Machine Learning (ML) analysis that improves sensitivity to these\nsubtle signals, offering a powerful complement to traditional search strategies\nto discover a new physics scenario.

This motivates the development of hybrid architectures that\ncombine digital neural networks with reconfigurable physical layers, which\neffectively behave as black boxes. In this work, we present a framework for the\nend-to-end training of such hybrid networks. This framework integrates\nstochastic zeroth-order optimization for updating the physical layer's internal\nparameters with a dynamic low-rank surrogate model that enables gradient\npropagation through the physical layer. A key component of our approach is the\nimplicit projector-splitting integrator algorithm, which updates the\nlightweight surrogate model after each forward pass with minimal hardware\nqueries, thereby avoiding costly full matrix reconstruction. We demonstrate our\nmethod across diverse deep learning tasks, including: computer vision, audio\nclassification, and language modeling.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a\nMulti-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP\n(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages\nproprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both\nclose-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant\nend-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed\nby the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational\nefficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness\nnear singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world\nenvironments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates\nand reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach\ndemonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong\ngeneralization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation\nin unstructured environments.
