In this work, for the first time, we apply\nconformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in\nnuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase\nshifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios:\n(i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field\ntheory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-Process model for the\ncoefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves\ncalculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each\ncase, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically.\nOur results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive\nuncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as\nskewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a\nrobust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties.",

            "summary": "Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that\ndark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect\nsuch conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary\nuse of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$\nand $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we\nconstruct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF),\ntrained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the\ndistribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find\nthat the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can\nbe reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed\npriors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with\n$\\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type\nIa supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken\ntogether, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises\nbecause uniform priors - often mischaracterized as \"uninformative\" - can\nactually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our\nresults underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to\nensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new\nhypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based\nframework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains,\nrequiring $\\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base\nanalysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the\nscalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.",

The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a\nHiggs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the\nboundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the\nsystem. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of\ngapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we\ndemonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class\nseparating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling\nwhile preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase\ntransition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and\ngroup-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global\nsymmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For\nSU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary\nphase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for\n$N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal\nchiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this\nmechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the\nhigher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break,\nexhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the\nelectric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect\ncondensation transition at the boundary.

Optimizing over $F(x;\n\\theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization,\nflow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as\nexisting computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically\nrepresentative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the\nchaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method\ndiverge exponentially as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large\ndegree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state\nstatistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method\nforward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \\theta)$ while\nsimultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\\theta$. A key\nfeature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster\noptimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to\navoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity.

            "summary": "In volatile financial markets, balancing risk and return remains a\nsignificant challenge. Traditional approaches often focus solely on equity\nallocation, overlooking the strategic advantages of options trading for dynamic\nrisk hedging. This work presents DeltaHedge, a multi-agent framework that\nintegrates options trading with AI-driven portfolio management. By combining\nadvanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based\nhedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes\nportfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone\nmodels, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management\nin complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper\ncontributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio\noptimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options\ntrading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.",

            "summary": "AI-driven digital ecosystems span diverse stakeholders including technology\nfirms, regulators, accelerators and civil society, yet often lack cohesive\nethical governance. This paper proposes a four-pillar framework (SCOR) to embed\naccountability, fairness, and inclusivity across such multi-actor networks.\nLeveraging a design science approach, we develop a Shared Ethical Charter(S),\nstructured Co-Design and Stakeholder Engagement protocols(C), a system of\nContinuous Oversight and Learning(O), and Adaptive Regulatory Alignment\nstrategies(R). Each component includes practical guidance, from lite modules\nfor resource-constrained start-ups to in-depth auditing systems for larger\nconsortia. Through illustrative vignettes in healthcare, finance, and smart\ncity contexts, we demonstrate how the framework can harmonize organizational\nculture, leadership incentives, and cross-jurisdictional compliance. Our\nmixed-method KPI design further ensures that quantitative targets are\ncomplemented by qualitative assessments of user trust and cultural change. By\nuniting ethical principles with scalable operational structures, this paper\noffers a replicable pathway toward responsible AI innovation in complex digital\necosystems.",

            "summary": "Signature-based methods have recently gained significant traction in machine\nlearning for sequential data. In particular, signature kernels have emerged as\npowerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on\ntime-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations\ndo not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice.\nWe present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised\nimplementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully\ncompatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient\nsoftware stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a\nnovel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate\ngradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.",
