By introducing a periodically quenched\ndriving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and\ndetermine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk\nbands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs\ncan be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and\n$\\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding\nnumbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet\nfidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the\nmomentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the\nmomentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of\nFEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also\nreveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like\ndispersion around $\\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin\neffect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at\nboth edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet\nengineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with\nsignificant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale.",

Contrary to the model-agnostic Bayesian analyses our\nscheme allows for distinguishing between the scenarios of neutron stars with\nquark cores and without them. The used quark model realizes asymptotic\nconformality at high densities in accordance with perturbative QCD. The\nhadronic sector is described by the density-dependent relativistic functional\nDD2Y-T, which satisfies chiral effective field theory constraints and includes\nhyperonic degrees of freedom. We construct a large set of candidate hybrid EOSs\nby varying the vector and diquark couplings and apply a Maxwell construction\nfor the quark-hadron phase transition. Observational constraints from recent\nNICER pulsar mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability from GW170817 are\nincorporated into the likelihood. Depending on whether the observational data\nfrom the black widow pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the HESS J1731-347 object are\nincluded to the analysis or not, the posterior distribution favors vector and\ndiquark couplings around $(\\eta_V,\\eta_D)\\simeq (0.82,0.40)$ or\n$(\\eta_V,\\eta_D)\\simeq (0.64,0.36)$, respectively. This corresponds to\nequations of state that support two-solar-mass neutron stars with\nsuperconformal speed of sound and relatively low onset densities for\ndeconfinement. Our findings indicate that the most probable hybrid EOSs are\nstatistically preferred over the purely hadronic baseline. The corresponding\nprobabilities of agreeing with the observational data differ by one or two\norders of magnitude depending on the data set used. This suggests that quark\ncores may exist in all observed neutron stars.",

In\ncontrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such\nas distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.\nSince such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth\ncameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual\ncapabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation.
