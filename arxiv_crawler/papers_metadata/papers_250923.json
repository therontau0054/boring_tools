            "summary": "Heavily doping graphene by intercalation can raise its Fermi level near an\nextended van Hove singularity, potentially inducing correlated electronic\nphases. Intercalation also modifies the band structure: dopants may hybridize\nwith carbon orbitals and order into $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ or $2\\times2$\nsuperstructures, introducing periodic potentials that fold the graphene $\\pi$\nbands. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy further shows a pronounced\nflattening of the conduction band near the M points, producing higher-order van\nHove singularities. These effects depend strongly on the dopant species and\nsubstrate, with implications for both many-body physics and transport. We\nconstruct effective tight-binding models that incorporate dopant ordering,\ncarbon-dopant hybridization, and $\\pi$-band renormalization. Model parameters\nare obtained from density functional theory and reproduce dispersions observed\nin photoemission experiments. Using these models, we compute the optical\nconductivity and identify characteristic signatures associated with dopant\nordering and hybridization. Our results provide a framework to interpret\nexperimental spectra and to probe the superlattice symmetry of highly doped\nmonolayer graphene.",

However, many open questions remain concerning\nthe anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate\ndoping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity\nupon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a\npseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and\nspectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a\nrecent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures.\nMeasurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops\nupon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track\nthis maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic\nanomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped\nmetal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of\nspectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform\nin the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this\nsignal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and\ndoping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped\nmetal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and\nsuggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in\nfuture work.

However, currently available open-source dLLMs\noften generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at\nevery denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality.

This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system.

            "summary": "A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and\ndiffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for\nneural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network)\nparameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on\ninfinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods\nto efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with\nrespect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to\nestimate the gradient expectation. In this work we introduce a novel training\ntechnique which bypasses and improves upon this Monte-Carlo simulation; we\nextend results in the theory of Wiener space cubature to approximate the\nexpected objective functional value by a weighted sum of functional evaluations\nof deterministic ODE solutions. Our main mathematical contribution enabling\nthis approximation is an extension of cubature bounds to the setting of\nLipschitz-nonlinear functionals acting on path-space. Our resulting\nconstructive algorithm allows for more computationally efficient training along\nseveral lines. First, it circumvents Brownian motion simulation and enables the\nuse of efficient parallel ODE solvers, thus decreasing the complexity of\npath-functional evaluation. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that\nthe number of paths required to achieve a given (expected loss functional\noracle value) approximation can be reduced in this deterministic cubature\nregime. Specifically, we show that under reasonable regularity assumptions we\ncan observe a O(1/n) convergence rate, where n is the number of path\nevaluations; in contrast with the standard O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of naive\nMonte-Carlo or the O(log(n)^d /n) rate of quasi-Monte-Carlo.",

However, IL policies often struggle when faced with\nout-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a\npreviously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,\nextensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and\ngeneralizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical\ninitial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task\nexecution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier\nto grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp\ntheir target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same\ncapability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their\ngiven policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which\nare outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses\nso that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we\nshow that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out\nthe given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET\nalgorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic\nteleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what\nsimplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into\nrobot action primitives.

The challenge lies in the\ncombinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can\ninclude multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification\ncombinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example,\n\"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists\nof two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of\nthe road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the\nintuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its\nconstituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.\nUsing diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then\ncomposes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of\nspecifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for\ndemonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training\nprocedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for\ndynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the\nbase model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world\nexperiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions\nby generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of\nspecifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based\npolicies and costmap composing baselines.
