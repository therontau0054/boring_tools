Our findings reveal that at $z\\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is\nfully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no\nnew physics at that redshift. However, at $z \\sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$\nshows a more than $5\\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\\Lambda$CDM\nprediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM model as\nconstrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\\sim 5\\sigma$\ntension at $z\\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may\nsignal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.",

We also\nstudy a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\\ell^{4}$,\nwhich includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical\nChern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings.

This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional\nfree theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet\ninsulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we\ninvestigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet\nphysics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological\ninsulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands\nwith zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous\nFloquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose\nbulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra\nwith open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to\nfinite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important\nrespects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the\nspectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries\nor on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the\nstatic discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has\na different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.",

The SM\nprovides a very good description of visible matter, with the proton being a\ncentral part of this understanding. The structure of the proton can be\nparametrised in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), essential inputs\nfor theoretical predictions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which cannot be\ncomputed from first principles and must be obtained from fits to experimental\ndata.\n  Despite the remarkable success of the SM, many fundamental questions remain\nunanswered, motivating the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).\nThese searches often rely on precise comparisons between theoretical\npredictions and experimental measurements. However, a significant challenge\narises because PDFs are typically determined under SM assumptions. This\napproach can introduce potential biases and inconsistencies in BSM searches.\nAdditionally, signals of BSM physics may be absorbed by the PDFs during the\nfitting procedure, further complicating the interpretation of the results.\n  This PhD thesis explores the interplay between PDFs and BSM physics. We\nintroduce the open-source release of SIMUnet, a deep learning framework\ndesigned to perform simultaneous fits of PDFs and BSM parameters, as well as to\nassess the potential absorption of BSM signals by the PDFs. We study the\nPDF-BSM interplay in the top sector and in a global dataset, and assess the\nabsorption of BSM physics in widely used models.

There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy\ncollision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on\ncurrent quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined\nmesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a\nparticle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple,\nexperimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of\ncolliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement\nstrength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We\nfind that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition\nof differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size\noscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are\ncontrolled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant\nconfinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial\nexcitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective\nmass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of\nthe central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with\ntime due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence\nof linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement\nlimit.

Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical\nenvironments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density,\nmomentum flux, and the total pressure.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate\nthe capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational\nframework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics\n(RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated\nmagnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and\nflux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are\ncombined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on\nblock-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results.\nWe introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative\nMHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann\nproblems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall\nthe basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion\nrelation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation\nfields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8\nlinear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three\nwave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion\nmode.

The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform\nmultidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited\nfor larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation\ninteractions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.",

Concretely, assume we are given a\nmeasurement matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ and noisy\nobservations $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{\\theta}^\\star + \\mathbf{\\xi}$ of a\nsignal $\\mathbf{\\theta}^\\star$ drawn from a spike-and-slab prior $\\pi$ with a\nGaussian diffuse density and expected sparsity k, where $\\mathbf{\\xi} \\sim\n\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbb{0}_n, \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}_n)$. We give a polynomial-time\nhigh-accuracy sampler for the posterior $\\pi(\\cdot \\mid \\mathbf{X},\n\\mathbf{y})$, for any SNR $\\sigma^{-1}$ > 0, as long as $n \\geq k^3 \\cdot\n\\text{polylog}(d)$ and $X$ is drawn from a matrix ensemble satisfying the\nrestricted isometry property. We further give a sampler that runs in\nnear-linear time $\\approx nd$ in the same setting, as long as $n \\geq k^5 \\cdot\n\\text{polylog}(d)$. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we extend\nour result to spike-and-slab posterior sampling with Laplace diffuse densities,\nachieving similar guarantees when $\\sigma = O(\\frac{1}{k})$ is bounded.",
