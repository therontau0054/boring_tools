The specific task is to distinguish between two\nquantum states given many copies. We use a reduction method of Haagerup, Junge,\nand Xu (2010) to approximate relative entropy inequalities in an arbitrary von\nNeumann algebra by those in finite von Neumann algebras. Within these finite\nvon Neumann algebras, it is possible to approximate densities via finite\nspectrum operators, after which the quantum method of types reduces them to\neffectively commuting subalgebras. Generalizing beyond the hyperfinite setting\nshows that the operational meaning of sandwiched R\\'enyi entropy is not\nrestricted to the matrices but is a more fundamental property of quantum\ninformation. Furthermore, applicability in general von Neumann algebras opens\npotential new connections to random matrix theory and the quantum information\ntheory of fundamental physics.",

However,\nour analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video\ndata often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their\nlearned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and\nthe underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a\nsimple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to\ninternalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's\nintermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them\nwith features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we\nintroduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which\nenforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,\nwhich preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric\nfeatures from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing\non both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual\nquality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

In this\nwork, we highlight the importance of the beam dumps, situated even further\nupstream, for such searches. The Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, with its iron\ndump, provides one such possibility. We focus on sub-GeV heavy neutral leptons\n(HNLs) with a transition magnetic moment, which allows this upscattering to\ntake advantage of the high-$Z$ iron. We observe that, in addition to increased\nsensitivity to this model at SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, there exist distinct\nfeatures in the signal events' kinematical properties when coming from\nproduction in the dump, dirt, and detector which can allow for enhanced\nsignal-to-background separation.

Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural\nnetworks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners\ncan dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal\nlearning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay\nbetween evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search\nfor optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the\nlearning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to\ninterpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine\nstatistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to\nidentify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the\nhigh-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations\nthat track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order\nparameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control\nproblem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of\nminimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework\nencompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and\ncontrol budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal\ncurricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising\nautoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how\noptimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing\nalignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.\nFinally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets.

Domain\nwall (DW) networks have recently been shown to generate an isotropic\nbirefringence signal in the ballpark of the measured value when coupled to\nphotons. In this work, we explore the axionic defects hypothesis in more detail\nand extending previous results to annihilating and late-forming networks, and\nby pointing out other smoking-gun signatures of the network in the CMB spectrum\nsuch as the anisotropic birefringent spectrum and B-modes. We also argue that\nthe presence of cosmic strings in the network does not hinder a large isotropic\nbirefringence signal because of an intrinsic environmental contribution coming\nfrom low redshifts thus leaving open the possibility that axionic defects can\nexplain the signal. Regarding the remaining CMB signatures, with the help of\ndedicated 3D numerical simulations of DW networks, that we took as a proxy for\nthe axionic defects, we show how the anisotropic birefringence spectrum\ncombined with a tomographic approach can be used to infer the formation and\nannihilation time of the network. From the numerical simulations, we also\ncomputed the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the network in\nthe post-recombination epoch and use previous searches for stochastic GW\nbackgrounds in the CMB to derive for the first time a bound on the tension and\nabundance of networks with DWs that annihilate after recombination.

Training\nexpressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable\nvalue maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online\nRL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are\nparameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient\npropagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some\nvalue function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value\nmaximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive\npolicy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We\npropose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL\nalgorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two\nparameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable\nimitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits\nthe actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.\nThe on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the\nlearned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and\nedited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup.

This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally.
