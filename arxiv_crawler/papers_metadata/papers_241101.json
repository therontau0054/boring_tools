            "summary": "Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics,\nreferring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a\nsystem by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The\noriginal concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has\nbeen implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to\nextend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a\nThouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of\ncoupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the\nsystem, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and\ngenerate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of\nexcitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within\nthe Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band\nexperience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the\nbands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band\ninversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our\nnumerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from\nexciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven\ntopological phases of matter.",

In this paper, we simulate neutrino quantum\nkinetics within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: we model the flavor evolution\nduring neutrino decoupling from matter in two spatial dimensions, one neutrino\nmomentum variable, and time; taking into account non-forward neutral current\nand charged current collisions of neutrinos with the matter background, as well\nas neutrino advection. In order to mimic fluctuations in the neutrino emission\nand matter background, and explore their effect on the flavor evolution, we\nintroduce perturbations in the collision term as well as in the vacuum term of\nthe Hamiltonian. Because of such perturbations, the initial symmetry of the\nneutrino field across the simulation annulus is broken and flavor conversion is\nqualitatively affected, with regions of larger flavor conversion alternating\nacross the simulation annulus. In addition, neutrino advection is responsible\nfor spreading flavor waves across neighboring spatial regions. Although based\non a simplified setup, our findings highlight the importance of modeling\nneutrino quantum kinetics in multi-dimensions to assess the impact of neutrinos\non the physics of compact astrophysical sources and nucleosynthesis.",

            "summary": "Scaling has been critical in improving model performance and generalization\nin machine learning. It involves how a model's performance changes with\nincreases in model size or input data, as well as how efficiently computational\nresources are utilized to support this growth. Despite successes in other\nareas, the study of scaling in Neural Network Interatomic Potentials (NNIPs)\nremains limited. NNIPs act as surrogate models for ab initio quantum mechanical\ncalculations. The dominant paradigm here is to incorporate many physical domain\nconstraints into the model, such as rotational equivariance. We contend that\nthese complex constraints inhibit the scaling ability of NNIPs, and are likely\nto lead to performance plateaus in the long run. In this work, we take an\nalternative approach and start by systematically studying NNIP scaling\nstrategies. Our findings indicate that scaling the model through attention\nmechanisms is efficient and improves model expressivity. These insights\nmotivate us to develop an NNIP architecture designed for scalability: the\nEfficiently Scaled Attention Interatomic Potential (EScAIP). EScAIP leverages a\nmulti-head self-attention formulation within graph neural networks, applying\nattention at the neighbor-level representations. Implemented with\nhighly-optimized attention GPU kernels, EScAIP achieves substantial gains in\nefficiency--at least 10x faster inference, 5x less memory usage--compared to\nexisting NNIPs. EScAIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide\nrange of datasets including catalysts (OC20 and OC22), molecules (SPICE), and\nmaterials (MPTrj). We emphasize that our approach should be thought of as a\nphilosophy rather than a specific model, representing a proof-of-concept for\ndeveloping general-purpose NNIPs that achieve better expressivity through\nscaling, and continue to scale efficiently with increased computational\nresources and training data.",

The stability of matter\nis an old and mathematically difficult problem, relying both on the uncertainty\nprinciple of quantum mechanics and on the exclusion principle of quantum\nstatistics. We consider here the stability of the self-interacting\nalmost-bosonic anyon gas, generalizing the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger energy functionals to include magnetic self interactions. We show\nthat there is a type of supersymmetry in the model which holds only for higher\nvalues of the magnetic coupling but is broken for lower values, and that in the\nformer case supersymmetric ground states exist precisely at even-integer\nquantized values of the coupling. These states constitute a manifold of\nexplicit solitonic vortex solutions whose densities solve a generalized\nLiouville equation, and can be regarded as nonlinear generalizations of Landau\nlevels.

This paper describes the extent to which a\nphysical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight.\nAnalysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over\ncollisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures\nthe hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two\nobservations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when\nthe time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the\ndistribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly\nsmaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the\ncombination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at\nshort timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the\nunderlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical\ntrajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of\nthe subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is\nseveral hundred times larger than the relaxation time.

In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge\n(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial\nand target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve\ngeometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge\nderived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric\nstates. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target\ngeometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition\nkernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB\nframework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more\ndetailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we\nconduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve\njoint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the\nunderlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.\nExperimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB\nsurpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for\naccurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges\nwith improved accuracy and applicability.",

            "summary": "Anomaly detection is widely used for identifying critical errors and\nsuspicious behaviors, but current methods lack interpretability. We leverage\ncommon properties of existing methods and recent advances in generative models\nto introduce counterfactual explanations for anomaly detection. Given an input,\nwe generate its counterfactual as a diffusion-based repair that shows what a\nnon-anomalous version should have looked like. A key advantage of this approach\nis that it enables a domain-independent formal specification of explainability\ndesiderata, offering a unified framework for generating and evaluating\nexplanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our anomaly explainability\nframework, AR-Pro, on vision (MVTec, VisA) and time-series (SWaT, WADI, HAI)\nanomaly datasets. The code used for the experiments is accessible at:\nhttps://github.com/xjiae/arpro.",

            "summary": "A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure\nof nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a\ngenerative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained\non 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction\npattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic\ncluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the\ninformation-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find\nthat our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small\nas 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity,\nincluding structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can\nsuccessfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five\ntimes, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by\npost-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving\nstructures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments.\nWe suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical\nsimulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of\npreviously unsolved nano-materials.",
