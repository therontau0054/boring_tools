            "summary": "This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous\nnavigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The\nproposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level\nnavigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task\nperformance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion\ncommands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to\nprevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation\nmethods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating\nerratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world\nvalidations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and\neffectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a\nscalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,\nreal-world scenarios.",

Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is\ndescribed by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the\nplanar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad\nmaster equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence,\nuniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad\ndissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium\nphase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first\nclass of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study\nnonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the\nexistence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the\nsecond class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of\nnonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the\nquantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary\nresults on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement\nbootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the\nnonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.",

The stability\nanalysis is carried out for a broad range of density ratios and geometric\nconfigurations, enabling the construction of stability diagrams in the (\\rho,k)\n-plane, where \\rho is the density ratio and k is the carrier wavenumber. The\nBenjamin-Feir index is used as the stability criterion, and its interplay with\nthe curvature of the dispersion relation is examined to determine the onset of\nmodulational instability. The topology of the stability diagrams reveals\nseveral characteristic structures: a localized loop of stability within an\ninstability zone, a global upper stability domain, an elongated corridor\nbounded by resonance and dispersion curves, and a degenerate cut structure\narising in strongly asymmetric configurations. Each of these structures is\nassociated with a distinct physical mechanism involving the balance between\nfocusing/defocusing nonlinearity and anomalous/normal dispersion. Systematic\nvariation of layer thicknesses allows us to track the formation, deformation,\nand disappearance of these regions, as well as their merging or segmentation\ndue to resonance effects. Limiting cases of semi-infinite layers are analyzed\nto connect the results with known configurations, including the\n`half-space--layer', `layer--half-space', and `half-space--half-space' systems.\nThe influence of symmetry and asymmetry in layer geometry is examined in\ndetail, showing how it governs the arrangement and connectivity of stable and\nunstable regions in parameter space.",

To probe beyond the SM physics, one needs to be able to subtract\nthe SM contributions, which consists of a non-perturbative part, namely, the\nhadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the photon. The state of the art is to\npredominantly use two different methods to extract this HVP: lattice\ncomputation, and dispersion relation-based, data-driven method. Thus one can\nconstruct different forms of the ``$a_{\\mu}$ test\" which compares the precise\nmeasurement of $a_{\\mu}$ to its theory prediction. Additionally, this opens the\npossibility for another subtle test, where these two ``theory\" predictions\nthemselves are compared against each other, which is denoted as the\n``HVP-test\". This test is particularly sensitive to hadronic scale new physics.\nTherefore, in this work, we consider a SM extension consisting of a generic,\nlight $\\sim(100~{\\rm MeV}-1~{\\rm GeV})$ vector boson and study its impact on\nboth tests. We develop a comprehensive formalism for this purpose. We find that\nin the case of data-driven HVP being used in the $a_{\\mu}$ test, the new\nphysics contributions effectively cancels for a flavor-universal vector boson.\nAs an illustration of these general results, we consider two benchmark models:\ni)~the dark photon ($\\,A'\\,$) and ii)~a gauge boson coupled to baryon-number\n($\\,B\\,$). Using a combination of these tests, we are able to constrain the\nparameter space of $B$ and $A'$, complementarily to the existing limits. As a\nspin-off, our preliminary analysis of the spectrum of invariant mass of $3\\pi$\nin events with ISR at the $B-$ factories (BaBar, Belle) manifests the value of\nsuch a study in searching for $B\\to 3\\pi$ decay, thus motivating a dedicated\nsearch by experimental collaborations.",

This leads us to introduce a\nclass of geometries, which we call almost generic elliptic/genus one fibered\nCalabi-Yau threefolds, and to make detailed conjectures about their properties.\nA second twisted circle compactification relates these M-theory vacua to Type\nIIA compactifications with flat but topologically non-trivial B-fields along\nthe internal geometry. The A-model topological string partition function on\nsuch configurations is intimately tied to the twisted-twined elliptic genera of\nthe six-dimensional non-critical strings of the associated F-theory vacuum.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition.
