This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables\ngeometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core\ncapabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video\nprediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved\nfeature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across\nreconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video\ngeneration models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real\ngeneralization despite never observing real-world data during training.\nFurthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action\nfollowing and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling.\nRemarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance far\nexceeds that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether leverages a\ngeometry-informed action space to seamlessly translate predictions into\nactions, enabling effective autonomous trajectory planning. We hope our work\ninspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world\nmodeling and its applications.",

            "summary": "We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave\nbackground (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various\npulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in\nthe expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field,\ncharacterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB\nmodel, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and\nEPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the\nordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the\nlikelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the\nfree spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher\nsignal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock\nspectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr\n(NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first\ntime while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current\nNG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal\nposteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is\n$B\\equiv Z_\\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\\mathrm{KA}=2.9\\pm1.9$, indicating comparable\nstatistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical\nmodel-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor\nspectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial\nspectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic\nmicrowave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer\nmeasurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by\nthe multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.",

Focusing\non the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \\(\\phi^4\\) theory, we demonstrate how\nloop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature\nof the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured\nthrough the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes\nthe colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space\nbackgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the\ncontractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the\nfield-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a\nuniversal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple\nmodels, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This\ngeometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight\ninto the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.",

We\nshow how the overdetermined problem can be resolved within our model for a\nclass of hybrid devices similar to that studied by Henneberg and Plunk (S.\nHenneberg and G. Plunk, PRR 2024). We are also able to solve the existence\nequation for flux surfaces analytically in the most general case by introducing\na special coordinate system. This will enable us to carry out an optimization\nseeking to minimize the error in our GSE while obeying the flux surface\nexistence equation, which will allow us to find solutions outside the class of\nhybrid devices. This will allow for a coarse-grained approximate search in the\nspace of quasisymmetric equilibria that should be faster than a conventional\nstellarator optimization.

By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and\nsemantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which\nsemantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay\nis quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes\nat a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy.\nEmpirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of \"surprising\" edges, links\nbetween semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or\ncross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the\nsystem exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a\nnegative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures,\nreinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish\nclear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive\ncomplex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability\nand continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the\nunderlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used\nby the reasoning process.

The governing equations\n(involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous\nmedia) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the\ninitial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the\nrole of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of\nboth the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual\nCherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c > 1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.

However, current training-free fast\nsamplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion.
