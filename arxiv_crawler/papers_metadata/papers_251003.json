More\nspecifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information\nto be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,\nand dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make\nthe following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each\nphysical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well\nas a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer\nthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the\nvisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer\nvision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and\ntrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and\nself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in\na generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though\nbehind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other\nmodels, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.",

Our strongest\nlimit sets a lower bound of O(1000 TeV) on the decay constant of the\nhypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\\eta_w$ could be a\ndark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those\nidentifications appear unlikely.

Beyond their\ncreative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for\nrobotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,\ncurrent approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object\ninteractions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video\ngeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and\neffects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method\ngenerates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We\npropose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion\nsupervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion\nmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,\nKineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual\nconditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support\nfor synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that\nKineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.\nAblation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and\nhigh-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made\npublicly available.",

These hybrid architectures\ncombine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate\ncollective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong\nshort-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering\nmany-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely\ndifferent length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable\nmodel for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we\nrestrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a\nkinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This\napproach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime\nof strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent\nframework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range\ninteractions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N\\'eel-ordered\nphases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase,\ndistinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we\nidentify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal\neigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving\nrise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time\nentanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these\nlong-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics.

Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,\ngiven the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to\nthe classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher\ninformation matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization\nof the relative entropy or the R\\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I\nderive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\\alpha$-$z$, and\ngeometric R\\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so\nbeing the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.\nInterestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$,\nthe log-Euclidean R\\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information\nmatrix, and the geometric R\\'enyi relative entropy leads to the\nright-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix.

Smith et al. in Quantitative\nFinance 2003, their arguments are rather heuristic and lack solid mathematical\nfoundation; indeed, their mean-field equations were derived with heuristic\narguments and their solutions were not explicitly obtained. In this work, we\nrevisit the mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model from the viewpoint of\nkinetic theory -- a traditional mathematical program in statistical physics. We\nstudy the exact master equation for the Santa Fe model and systematically\nderive the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchical equation.\nBy applying the mean-field approximation, we derive the mean-field equation for\nthe order-book density profile, parallel to the Boltzmann equation in\nconventional statistical physics. Furthermore, we obtain explicit and closed\nexpression of the mean-field solutions. Our solutions have several\nimplications: (1)Our scaling formulas are available for both $\\mu\\to 0$ and\n$\\mu\\to \\infty$ asymptotics, where $\\mu$ is the market-order submission\nintensity. Particularly, the mean-field theory works very well for small $\\mu$,\nwhile its validity is partially limited for large $\\mu$. (2)The ``method of\nimage'' solution, heuristically derived by Bouchaud-M\\'ezard-Potters in\nQuantitative Finance 2002, is obtained for large $\\mu$, serving as a\nmathematical foundation for their heuristic arguments. (3)Finally, we point out\nan error in E. Smith et al. 2003 in the scaling law for the diffusion constant\ndue to a misspecification in their dimensional analysis.",
