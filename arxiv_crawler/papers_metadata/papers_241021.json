            "summary": "Tackling sampling noise due to finite shots of quantum measurement is an\nunavoidable challenge when extracting information in machine learning with\nphysical systems. Eigentask Learning was developed in recent work as a\nframework for learning in the presence of sampling noise. In that work,\nnumerical evidence was presented that extracting low-noise contributions of\nfeatures can improve performance for machine learning tasks, displaying\nrobustness to overfitting, and increasing generalization accuracy. The issue of\ncharacterizing generalization errors in situations where the training dataset\nis finite remains unresolved in the previous work. In this study, we use\nmethodologies from statistical mechanics to calculate the training and\ngeneralization errors of a generic quantum machine learning system when the\ninput training dataset and output measurement sampling shots are both finite.\nOur analytical findings, supported by numerical validation, offer solid\njustification that Eigentask Learning provides optimal learning in the sense of\nminimizing generalization errors.",

This situation happens in\nmany scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography,\nmagneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are\ndifficult to normalize.\n  Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)\nstatistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an\nintuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a\nbiased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation.\nWe then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM)\nalgorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the\nlog-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is\nproved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition\nfunction and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal\nperformance.

Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach\nreproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the\nnumber of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and\nthermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated\nWigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the\ndual steps.

Another distinct advantage of\nour algorithm lies in its semi-supervised learning framework, enabling it to\nfully use the additional unlabeled data. This ability enhances the performance\nby allowing the algorithm to dig the spectrum and curvature of the data\nmanifold, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset.\nMoreover, our algorithm performs in an entirely data-driven manner, operating\ndirectly within the intrinsic manifold structure of the data, without requiring\nany predefined manifold information.

However, prior works on TS\ndiffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other\ndomains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for\nTime series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper\nnoise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing\nnon-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should\nsatisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity\nof TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is\ncorrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is\nsufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it\neliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small\nadditional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done\noffline before training.

Traditional deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network\nperformance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently.
