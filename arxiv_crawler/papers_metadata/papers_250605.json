We employ blurring filters and a\nDRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in\ndevices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and\nmeasurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a\nTE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating\nreflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced\nfrom 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy.

            "summary": "The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains\nchallenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial\ndimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this\nend, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation\nprotocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources\nrequired to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work\nintroduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states\nbased on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which\nprovides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate\nhighly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The\nalgorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA\ntechniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical\nsimulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to\naccurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial\ninsulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian\nstates alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical\nupper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that\nare adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for\nimplementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a\nfoundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a\nnovel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological\norder, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations\nwith constant Pauli weight independent of system size.",

While BM postulates particles with definite trajectories\nguided by the wave function, the ontological status of the wave function itself\nremains contested. Critics of the causal interpretation argue that the wave\nfunction's high-dimensionality and lack of back-reaction disqualify it as a\nphysical entity. Proponents of the nomological interpretation, drawing\nparallels to the classical Hamiltonian, propose that the wave function is a\n\"law-like\" entity. However, this view faces challenges, including reliance on\nspeculative quantum gravity frameworks (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) and\nconceptual ambiguities about the nature of \"nomological entities\". By\nsystematically comparing BM to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, this paper highlights\ndisanalogies between the wave function and the classical action function. These\ndifferences, particularly the wave function's dynamical necessity and\nirreducibility, support a sui generis interpretation, where the wave function\nrepresents a novel ontological category unique to quantum theory. The paper\nconcludes that the wave function's role in BM resists classical analogies,\ndemanding a metaphysical framework that accommodates its non-local,\nhigh-dimensional, and dynamically irreducible nature.",

These extremal action paths may stem from\nspatial inequality constraints (as in the double slit experiment), from\nsingularities in the Hamiltonian (as in a Coulomb potential), from a closed\nconfiguration manifold (as for a spinning particle), or just from the initial\naction distribution. We show that the exact Schr\\\"odinger wave function $\\Psi$\nof the original quantum problem can be constructed by combining this classical\nmulti-valued action $\\Phi$ with the density $\\rho$ of the classical position\ndynamics, which can be computed from $\\Phi$ along each extremal action path.\nThis construction is general and does not involve any quasi-classical\napproximation.\n  Quantum wave collapse corresponds to transitioning between multi-valued\nclassical action branches at a branch point (e.g., position measurement), or to\nmeasuring the classical eigendensity field (e.g., momentum or energy\nmeasurement). Entanglement corresponds to a sum of classical individual\nparticle actions mapping to a tensor product of spinors.\n  Examples illustrate how the quantum wave functions for the double-slit\nexperiment, the hydrogen atom, or EPR can be computed exactly from their\nclassical least action counterparts.\n  These coordinate-invariant results provide a simpler computing alternative to\nFeynman path integrals, as they use only a discrete set of classical paths and\navoid zig-zag paths and time-slicing altogether.

A classic example is the way in\nwhich microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome\nsegregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized\nby apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and\nshrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological\nprocesses for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather\nthe final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and\nnecessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind\nof cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and\nchemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we\nexamine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random\ntrajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of\nthese trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by\nreviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context\nof physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then\nstacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit\nexploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative\nexamination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for\nexploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series\nof repeated trials that ultimately end in a \"winning\" trajectory.

Despite\noften being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter\nmodel outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper\nintroduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can\neffectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding\nminimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its\nlatent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP\ncumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input\ndata. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy\nimages reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach\nto neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion\nmodel is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean\nrepresentation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive\nexperiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths\nin three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing\ndefense techniques by a substantial margin.
