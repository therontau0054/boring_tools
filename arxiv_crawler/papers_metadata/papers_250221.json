            "summary": "One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic\nworld (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new\nphysics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational\nself-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a\nHeisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than\na critical mass $M_{\\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\\rm P}$) would\nbe necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively.\nOur effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum\nparticles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\\rm C}$. The purity\nloss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient\nfor quantum particles with $m \\ll M_{\\rm C}$ but very effective for those with\n$m \\sim M_{\\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would\n(easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum\ndegrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with\nstate-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future\nStern-Gerlach-like experiment.",

Compared to non-concatenated codes and non-adaptive syndrome\nextraction, we find that the adaptive scheme achieves over an order of\nmagnitude lower logical error rates while requiring fewer CNOT gates and\nphysical qubits.

However, many believe that it is\ndifficult, if possible at all, to achieve the microsecond latency requirement\nposed by superconducting qubits. This work presents the first publicly known\nMWPM decoder, called Micro Blossom, that achieves sub-microsecond decoding\nlatency. Micro Blossom employs a heterogeneous architecture that carefully\npartitions a state-of-the-art MWPM decoder between software and a programmable\naccelerator with parallel processing units, one of each vertex/edge of the\ndecoding graph. On a surface code with code distance $d$ and a circuit-level\nnoise model with physical error rate $p$, Micro Blossom's accelerator employs\n$O(d^3)$ parallel processing units to reduce the worst-case latency from\n$O(d^{12})$ to $O(d^9)$ and reduce the average latency from $O(p d^3+1)$ to\n$O(p^2 d^2+1)$ when $p \\ll 1$.\n  We report a prototype implementation of Micro Blossom using FPGA. Measured at\n$d=13$ and $p=0.1\\%$, the prototype achieves an average decoding latency of\n$0.8 \\mu s$ at a moderate clock frequency of $62 MHz$. Micro Blossom is the\nfirst publicly known hardware-accelerated exact MWPM decoder, and the decoding\nlatency of $0.8 \\mu s$ is 8 times shorter than the best latency of MWPM decoder\nimplementations reported in the literature.",

In this study, we propose a novel rectified\nquaternion flow (ReQFlow) matching method for fast and high-quality protein\nbackbone generation. In particular, our method generates a local translation\nand a 3D rotation from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, which\nrepresents each 3D rotation as a unit quaternion and constructs its flow by\nspherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an exponential format. We train the\nmodel by quaternion flow (QFlow) matching with guaranteed numerical stability\nand rectify the QFlow model to accelerate its inference and improve the\ndesignability of generated protein backbones, leading to the proposed ReQFlow\nmodel.
