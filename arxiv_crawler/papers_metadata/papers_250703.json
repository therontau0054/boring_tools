Using tensor network methods, we\nstudy the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between\ntwo static charges in the $2+1$D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We\ncalculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string\nconfigurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances\ndetermined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various\nstring breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance\nstrings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields,\nwe fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in\nmaximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical\nregime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the\nlatter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and\ntrapped-ion quantum processors.",

Stellar\nspectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical\ninformation about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets\nimproves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and\nchemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and\nprecision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.\nAdditionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities\noffer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively\ntrained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance\nprecision stellar spectroscopy.",

Therefore, the development of advanced technologies\nharnessing chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and\ncontrolling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond time scales.\nSuch endeavors have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized\ncircularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been\novercome (Han et al.

We show that co-rotating attosecond\nand near-infrared pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign\ncompared to single-photon ionisation. We demonstrate that chiral\nphotoionisation delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of\nphotoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring three-dimensional\nmomentum resolution. We measure forward-backward chiral-sensitive delays of up\nto 120 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionisation delays up to 240 as, which\ninclude an asymmmetry of $\\sim$60 as originating from chirality in the\ncontinuum-continuum transitions.

Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically\nrequire deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and\nimperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum\ncircuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for\nquantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising\npath forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational\nansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli\npropagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that\nimplement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and\nbeyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to\n$30 \\times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard\nTrotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To\nexperimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on\nQuantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's\ndynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without\noptimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a\npractical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced\nquantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of\nhardware-friendly ans\\\"atze.",

            "summary": "The dispersion phenomenon of mass and heat transport in oscillatory flows has\nwide applications in environmental, physiological and microfluidic flows. The\nmethod of concentration moments is a powerful theoretical tool for analyzing\ntransport characteristics and is well-developed for steady flows. However, the\ngeneral solutions of moments derived by Barton (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983,\npp. 205-218) cannot be applied directly to unsteady flows. Prior studies needed\nto re-solve the governing equations of moments from scratch, encountering the\ncomplication induced by the time-periodic velocity, leaving higher-order\nstatistics like skewness and kurtosis analytically intractable except for\nspecific cases. This work proposes a novel approach based on a\ntwo-time-variable extension to tackle these challenges. By introducing an\nauxiliary time variable, referred to as oscillation time to characterize the\ninherent oscillation in the dispersion due to the oscillating flow, the\ntransport problem is extended to a two-time-variable system with a \"steady\"\nflow term. This enables the direct use of Barton's expressions and thus avoids\nthe prior complication. This approach not only offers an intuitive physical\nperspective for the influence of the velocity oscillation but also clarifies\nthe solution structure of concentration moments. As a preliminary verification,\nwe examine the transport problem in an oscillatory Couette flow. The analytical\nsolution agrees well with the numerical result by Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. The effects of the point-source release and the phase shift of\nvelocity on the transport characteristics are investigated. By extending the\nclassic steady-flow solution to the time-dependent flows, this work provides a\nversatile framework for transient dispersion analysis, enhancing predictions in\noscillatory transport problems.",

            "summary": "Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling\nlanguage-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks.",
