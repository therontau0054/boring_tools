            "summary": "Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in\ncomputationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields\ndue to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing\nphysical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through\nmathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions\nwithin a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets\ninfluences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational\nspeed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of\nparameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we\nuse low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to\nachieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with\nautomatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted\npotential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP)\nmodel and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy\nalloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed\napproach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and\ncan be applied to compress other MLIPs.",

A closely related study concluded that MMM\npredicted electron ($T_e$) and ion ($T_i$) temperature profiles that were in\nreasonable agreement with NSTX observations, generally outperforming a\ndifferent reduced transport model, TGLF, motivating a more thorough\ninvestigation of the characteristics of the MMM predictions. The simulations\nwith MMM have electron energy transport dominated by electron temperature\ngradient modes for relatively low plasma $\\beta$ and high collisionality,\ntransitioning to a mixture of different modes for higher $\\beta$ and lower\ncollisionality. The thermal ion diffusivity predicted by MMM is much smaller\nthan the neoclassical contribution, in line with previous experimental analysis\nof NSTX. Nonetheless, the $T_e$ and $T_i$ profiles are coupled via collisional\nenergy exchange and thus sensitive to which transport channels are predicted.\nThe simulations with MMM are robust to the simulation start time, converging to\nremarkably similar temperatures later during the discharge. MMM typically\noverpredicts confinement relative to NSTX observations, leading to the\nprediction of overly steep profiles. Plasmas with spatially broader $T_e$\nprofiles, higher $\\beta$, and longer energy confinement times tend to be\npredicted by MMM with better agreement with the experiment.

Overall, it\nis found that simulations using the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) more consistently\nagree with the NSTX observations than those using the Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid\n(TGLF) model, despite TGLF requiring orders of magnitude greater computational\ncost. When considering all examined discharges, MMM has median overpredictions\nof electron temperature ($T_e$) and ion temperature ($T_i$) profiles of 28% and\n27%, respectively, relative to the experiment. TGLF overpredicts $T_e$ by 46%,\nwith much larger variance than MMM, and underpredicts $T_i$ by 25%. As $\\beta$\nis increased across NSTX discharges, TGLF predicts lower $T_e$ and significant\nflattening of the $T_i$ profile, conflicting with NSTX observations. When using\nan electrostatic version of TGLF, both $T_e$ and $T_i$ are substantially\noverpredicted, underscoring the importance of electromagnetic turbulence in the\nhigh $\\beta$ spherical tokamak regime. Additionally, calculations with neural\nnet surrogate models for TGLF were performed outside of TRANSP with a time\nslice flux matching transport solver, finding better agreement with experiment\nthan the TRANSP simulations, highlighting the impact of different transport\nsolvers and simulation techniques.

            "summary": "Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields\nand 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer\nto 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

Our\nfindings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which\nenable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and\nultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that\npioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction.
