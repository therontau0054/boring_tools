            "summary": "Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the\ndemand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.

Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite\nentanglement as inter-network resource.

To this aim, we first design the\nmultipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show\nhow such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to\ndifferent QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic\npatterns.

To fulfill their prospects, quantum simulators must be\nfully controllable, allowing for precise tuning of the microscopic physical\nparameters that define their implementation. We consider Rydberg-atom arrays, a\npromising platform for quantum simulations. Experimental control of such arrays\nis limited by the imprecision on the optical tweezers positions when assembling\nthe array, hence introducing uncertainties in the simulated Hamiltonian. In\nthis work, we introduce a scalable approach to Hamiltonian learning using graph\nneural networks (GNNs). We employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group\n(DMRG) to generate ground-state snapshots of the transverse field Ising model\nrealized by the array, for many realizations of the Hamiltonian parameters.\nCorrelation functions reconstructed from these snapshots serve as input data to\ncarry out the training. We demonstrate that our GNN model has a remarkable\ncapacity to extrapolate beyond its training domain, both regarding the size and\nthe shape of the system, yielding an accurate determination of the Hamiltonian\nparameters with a minimal set of measurements. We prove a theorem establishing\na bijective correspondence between the correlation functions and the\ninteraction parameters in the Hamiltonian, which provides a theoretical\nfoundation to our learning algorithm.

On\nthe other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives\nin energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that\nnonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a\ndamped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to\nnonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness\nagainst disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for\nsteady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a\nfine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium\ncase. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition\ndriven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a\ntime-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by\nthe geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete\nsymmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple\nharmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down.\nOur predictions have important physical implications for a three-component\nspinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the\nstructural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated\nself-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation\ndespite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths.",

For perturbative theories, estimates of the first\nneglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp\nbounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics,\nit is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such\na diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime,\nwhere scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use\nthe growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for\nperturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily\nused in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit.\nMore in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density\noperator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an\neffective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it\nperturbatively. Constraints on the regime of validity of perturbation theory\nare then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.\n  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial\nwaves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences:\npurity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no\npartial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field\ntheories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in\ninflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time\nevolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of\nthe physical kinematics.",
