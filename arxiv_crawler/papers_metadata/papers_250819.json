            "summary": "This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation\nand downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is\nmodeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves\nas input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first\nturbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN)\ncontribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher\nfrequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN\nmostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more\npronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than\nin staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall\nbecause turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow\nsignificantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition\nmodifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an\nisolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound\nfocusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to\nhigher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm\ncompared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based\non isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating\nflow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of\nwind farms.",

To date, however, all studies have\nfocused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched\nthat quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled\npartners. In this work we propose data-driven tests of spin-lifetime and\nlifetime-lifetime correlations for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in\nhigh-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices\nof Delta t, constructing a pair-wise spin-lifetime correlator, and testing a\nsimple lifetime-lifetime covariance, we search for deviations from independent\nexponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Observation of\nnonzero lifetime correlations would compel a reassessment of how entanglement\nmanifests in decaying systems, revealing hitherto unexplored temporal\ncoherence.",

            "summary": "Extreme weather events epitomize high cost: to society through their physical\nimpacts, and to computer servers that are used to simulate them to provide\ninformation to mitigate those impacts. It costs hundreds of years to sample a\nfew once-per-century events with straightforward model integration, but that\ncost can be much reduced with rare event sampling, which nudges ensembles of\nsimulations to convert moderate events to severe ones, e.g., by steering a\ncyclone directly through a region of interest. With proper statistical\naccounting, rare event algorithms can provide quantitative climate risk\nassessment at reduced cost. But this can only work if ensemble members diverge\nfast enough. Sudden, transient events characteristic of Earth's midlatitude\nstorm track regions, such as heavy precipitation and heat extremes, pose a\nparticular challenge because they come and go faster than an ensemble can\nexplore the possibilities. Here we extend standard rare event algorithms to\nhandle this challenging case in an idealized atmospheric general circulation\nmodel, achieving 5-10 times sped-up estimation of long return periods, such as\n100-150 years from only 20 years of simulation for extremes of daily\nprecipitation and surface temperature. The algorithm, called TEAMS\n(``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting''), was developed previously in\nFinkel and O'Gorman (2024) using a toy chaotic system, and relies on a key\nparameter -- the advance split time -- which may be estimated based on simple\ndiagnostics of ensemble dispersion rates.

This challenge requires detailed\nengineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows,\nand PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably\ngenerate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle\nto manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop,\nphysics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs\nand PIDs.

Using\nboth analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck\nequations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the\ncapacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its\nplates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical\nprocesses involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its\nfunctional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case\nof a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to\nhave the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and\npresent results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary\nelectrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to\nunderstand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At\nhigher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear\nregime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the\nbuild-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass\ndiffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the\nNernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime\n(intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially\ndue to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident.\nIn the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass\nare completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time.\nWe finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions\nfor which mean-field is expected to hold.",

The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect\noverall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this\nmultiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the\napplication of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use\nformal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for\nmacroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with\nperiodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We\nderive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with\nthe membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry.\nOur results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to\na wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes\nwith long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling\nconditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions\nin the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes\ncalled porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily\ndominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how\nalterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin\nexpression, might affect overall transport, including when external\nconcentrations vary in time.

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO.
