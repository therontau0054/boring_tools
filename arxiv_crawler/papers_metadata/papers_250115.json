            "summary": "The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band\nwaves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton\ngyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency),\nwith the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower\nfrequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has\nbeen shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A\ntheory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been\npresented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence\nof low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field,\nsuch fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel\nelectric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to\nconclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe\npasses through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant\nwave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric\nfields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron\nheating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence\nof TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed\nmechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.",

Typical viscosities in these and many other\nkitchen flows, and the heights from which the streams are dispensed, make such\njets susceptible to the coiling instability. Indeed, the coiling of a thin\nthread of poured maple syrup is a source of fascination for children and adults\nalike, whereas the folding of the stream of ketchup squeezed out from a plastic\nbottle is a phenomenon familiar to all. In this paper, we review the fluid\ndynamics of such kitchen flows and discuss separately the case when the\nsubstrate is stationary (honey on a toast), and when it translates (cookies on\na conveyor belt) or rotates (a pancake on a spinning hot plate). It is hoped\nthat this may encourage experimentation and enjoyment of physics in the\nkitchen, and perhaps even lead to more elegant if not more tasty culinary\nresults.",

However, the high computational costs\nassociated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of\nCoarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional\ncompression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced\ncomputational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD\nmethods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to\ngenerate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a\nrange of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization\nwith applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to\ndomain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed\nare critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results\nfrom CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for\ndomain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have\ndeveloped and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of\npolymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our\noptimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve\naccuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of\nCGMD.

Space missions, even if small,\nare expensive and hard to replicate; yet, the essence of physics is\nrepeatability. This work is an assessment of the Microscope results based on\nthe laws of physics and knowledge from previous experiments, focusing on the\nlimiting thermal noise and the treatment of acceleration outliers. Thermal\nnoise reveals anomalies that we explain by stray sub-microVolt potentials\ncaused by patch charges, giving rise to an unstable zero. The measurements were\naffected by numerous acceleration spikes occurring at the synodic frequencies\nrelative to the Earth (the signal frequency) and the Sun, which we interpret as\nevidence of a thermal origin. In Microscope authors' analysis, the spikes were\nremoved and the resulting gaps replaced with artificial data (up to 35, 40 per\ncent of the sessions data), which retain memory of the gaps and may simulate or\ncancel an effect (signal or systematic). An alternative approach based\nexclusively on real measured data would avoid any ambiguity. The lessons of\nMicroscope are crucial to any futures improved mission.",

Over the past\ndecade, their discovery has spurred extensive research into electronic systems\nand other Bloch-wave systems, such as photonic and phononic crystals. However,\ncurrent studies typically focus on type-II DPs along high-symmetry directions\nin the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) under mirror symmetry conditions, which are\nhighly restrictive and limit further investigations and applications. To\novercome the stringent constraint, here we identify and demonstrate the\nemergence of type-II DPs at general positions inside the FBZ without requiring\nthe mirror symmetry. The type-II DPs, being accidental degeneracies, are\nexperimentally realized on a metacrystal slab with H-shaped metallic patterns.\nOur findings indicate that even in the absence of mirror symmetry, type-II DPs\ncan emerge at designated locations inside the FBZ by simply rotating the\nH-shaped patterns and adjusting geometrical and physical parameters.\nFurthermore, based on the rotated type-II DPs, off-axis conical diffractions\nhave been both realized and experimentally observed. Meanwhile, we discovered\nthat during the rotation process, the type-II DPs transform into off-axis\ntype-I DPs, but still strongly tilted, resulting in the emergence of negative\nrefractions. Hence, the generic method we propose for inducing type-II or\nstrongly tilted type-I DPs without the high-symmetry limitations opens\npotential avenues for related research. For example, the observed off-axis\nconical diffraction and negative refraction could inspire future development\nand applications in photonics and other Bloch-wave systems.",

Does the plateau width increase or\ndecrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the\nlongitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the\nlongitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there\n\"floating\" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can\ndisorder destroy the IQHE?

Our detailed theory provides\nanswers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We\ndiscuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest\nfuture experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and\ntemperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an\nintricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE\nplateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder.

Using the Swampland weak gravity conjecture, we show that the\nfluctuations of the ensemble average are below the BTZ threshold and correspond\nto a sublattice of superextremal states emitted by the black hole. We exploit\nthe logarithmic density of states to derive bounds on the charged vectors of\nthe abelian CS symmetry and introduce a novel formulation of the density\nfunction to ensure consistency with the sublattice WGC.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses and\naccelerates diffusion models without retraining, but it inevitably introduces\nadditional quantization noise, resulting in mean and variance deviations. In\nthis work, we propose D2-DPM, a dual denoising mechanism aimed at precisely\nmitigating the adverse effects of quantization noise on the noise estimation\nnetwork. Specifically, we first unravel the impact of quantization noise on the\nsampling equation into two components: the mean deviation and the variance\ndeviation. The mean deviation alters the drift coefficient of the sampling\nequation, influencing the trajectory trend, while the variance deviation\nmagnifies the diffusion coefficient, impacting the convergence of the sampling\ntrajectory. The proposed D2-DPM is thus devised to denoise the quantization\nnoise at each time step, and then denoise the noisy sample through the inverse\ndiffusion iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that D2-DPM achieves\nsuperior generation quality, yielding a 1.42 lower FID than the full-precision\nmodel while achieving 3.99x compression and 11.67x bit-operation acceleration.",
