            "summary": "In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by\ngauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we\nrecently demonstrated in the context of the $U\\left(1\\right)$ and\n$SU\\left(2\\right)$ Higgs models\n\\cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of\ngauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known\ngauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their\nK\\\"{a}ll\\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively.\nDespite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as\nelementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their\ncomputation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to\ncompute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This\ntrick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to\nthe composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the\ntraditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary\nfields.",

            "summary": "We consider the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) or Neural Networks (NNs) to\nnumerically approximate the solutions to nonlinear partial differential\nequations (PDEs) with rough forcing or source terms, which commonly arise as\npathwise solutions to stochastic PDEs. Kernel methods have recently been\ngeneralized to solve nonlinear PDEs by approximating their solutions as the\nmaximum a posteriori estimator of GPs that are conditioned to satisfy the PDE\nat a finite set of collocation points. The convergence and error guarantees of\nthese methods, however, rely on the PDE being defined in a classical sense and\nits solution possessing sufficient regularity to belong to the associated\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose a generalization of these methods\nto handle roughly forced nonlinear PDEs while preserving convergence guarantees\nwith an oversmoothing GP kernel that is misspecified relative to the true\nsolution's regularity. This is achieved by conditioning a regular GP to satisfy\nthe PDE with a modified source term in a weak sense (when integrated against a\nfinite number of test functions). This is equivalent to replacing the empirical\n$L^2$-loss on the PDE constraint by an empirical negative-Sobolev norm. We\nfurther show that this loss function can be used to extend physics-informed\nneural networks (PINNs) to stochastic equations, thereby resulting in a new\nNN-based variant termed Negative Sobolev Norm-PINN (NeS-PINN).",

In each of\nthem, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance one of the possible halves\nof the information about the solution she will produce and measure in the\nfuture and could use this knowledge to produce the solution with fewer\ncomputation steps. Involving only the measurements of commuting observables,\nquantum algorithms are submitted to the same (classical) logic and should\ntherefore host the quantum superposition of the causal loops in question.\nHowever, their ordinary quantum description does not and, being causal in\ncharacter, cannot describe causal loops. It must therefore be incomplete and is\nin fact completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the unitary part of the\nordinary quantum description of the quantum algorithm mathematically unaltered\nbut changes the behavior of causality along it. The single causal process of\nthe ordinary quantum superposition is replaced by the quantum superposition of\nthe causal loops in question. In their completed quantum description, quantum\nalgorithms respond to the pre-scientific notion of teleological evolution, that\nis, an evolution toward a goal (the solution) with an attractor in the goal it\nwill produce in the future (the solution again). Once applied to the evolutions\nof the living, this notion was dismissed with the advent of modern science for\nthe alleged absence of a physical basis.

For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch\nstates have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical\nproperties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the\nFloquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as\npulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their\nformation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of\nFloquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids\nthat remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of\nbulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to\nfinally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and\nuse it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of\nfull-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated,\nabsorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a\nwide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of\nthe Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely\noptical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states\nwhile avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band\nstructure.",

The wormhole amplitude matches the spectral\ncorrelation of a finite-cut matrix integral, where matrices have large but\nfinite dimensions. This strongly suggests an identification of the sine dilaton\ngravity theory with the q-deformed JT gravity matrix integral. At the very\nleast, it captures all universal content of that matrix model. The disk\ndecomposes into the physical (gauge invariant) solutions of the WdW equation,\nwhich are trumpets with discrete sizes. This decomposition modifies the usual\nno-boundary wavefunction to a normalizable one in sine dilaton gravity. We\nfurthermore present an exact quantization of sine dilaton gravity with open and\nclosed end of the world branes. These EOW branes correspond with FZZT branes\nfor the two Liouville theories that make up sine dilaton gravity. The WdW\nequation implies redundancies in this space of branes, leaving a one parameter\nfamily of gauge invariant branes. One gauge choice corresponds with branes\ndiscussed by Okuyama in the context of chord diagrams and of DSSYK. Legendre\ntransforming the EOW brane amplitude reproduces the trumpet, independent of the\nWdW quantization calculation.

Our approach addresses these challenges by combining the\ngeometric expressiveness of message-passing neural networks with the global\nreasoning of Transformers, enabling efficient learning of inverse mappings from\nboundary conditions to complete states. We evaluate this framework on a\ncomprehensive dataset of steady-state RANS simulations around diverse airfoil\ngeometries, where the task is to reconstruct full pressure and velocity fields\nfrom surface pressure measurements alone. The architecture achieves high\nreconstruction accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. We conduct\nexperiments and provide insights into the relative importance of local\ngeometric processing and global attention mechanisms in mesh-based inverse\nproblems.

These visuals represent\nadditional stimuli during the memorisation process. To explore the\neffectiveness of this approach we first run a pilot study to investigate how\ndifficult it is to externalise the descriptions of mental visualisations of\nmemorable links, by asking participants to write them down.

The goal of this manuscript is to explain, from a PDE\nperspective, how this method works and how to derive the PDE governing the\nreverse dynamics as well as to study its solution analytically. By linking\nforward and reverse dynamics, we show that the reverse process's distribution\nhas its support contained within the original distribution. Consequently,\ndiffusion methods, in their analytical formulation, do not inherently\nregularize the original distribution, and thus, there is no generalization\nprinciple. This raises a question: where does generalization arise, given that\nin practice it does occur? Moreover, we derive an explicit solution to the\nreverse process's SDE under the assumption that the starting point of the\nforward process is fixed. This provides a new derivation that links two popular\napproaches to generative diffusion models: stable diffusion (discrete dynamics)\nand the score-based approach (continuous dynamics). Finally, we explore the\ncase where the original distribution consists of a finite set of data points.\nIn this scenario, the reverse dynamics are explicit (i.e., the loss function\nhas a clear minimizer), and solving the dynamics fails to generate new samples:\nthe dynamics converge to the original samples.
