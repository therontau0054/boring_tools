            "summary": "Symbolic regression is essential for deriving interpretable expressions that\nelucidate complex phenomena by exposing the underlying mathematical and\nphysical relationships in data. In this paper, we present an advanced symbolic\nregression method that integrates symbol priors from diverse scientific domains\n- including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering - into the regression\nprocess. By systematically analyzing domain-specific expressions, we derive\nprobability distributions of symbols to guide expression generation. We propose\nnovel tree-structured recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverage these\nsymbol priors, enabling domain knowledge to steer the learning process.\nAdditionally, we introduce a hierarchical tree structure for representing\nexpressions, where unary and binary operators are organized to facilitate more\nefficient learning. To further accelerate training, we compile characteristic\nexpression blocks from each domain and include them in the operator dictionary,\nproviding relevant building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nleveraging symbol priors significantly enhances the performance of symbolic\nregression, resulting in faster convergence and higher accuracy.",

            "summary": "We allow the Higgs field $\\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\\chi$ of\nthe background spacetime via the coupling $\\chi^2\\,\\Phi^\\dagger\\Phi$. Upon\nspontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to\n$\\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass\nand particle masses dependent on $\\chi$, we present an $\\textit alternative$\nmechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\\hbar$\nand speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point\n$x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the\nGlashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of\n$\\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\\hbar_*\\propto\\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and\n$c_*\\propto\\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary\nalongside the dynamical field $\\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$,\nthe prevailing value $\\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for\nphysical processes occurring in this region as $l\\propto\\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and\n$\\tau\\propto\\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\\textit anisotropic$ relation\n$\\tau^{-1}\\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods,\nresulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time\ncosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from\ndistant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications\nto the Lema\\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are\ncapable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\\textit{through a\ndeclining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus\navoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing\nBlanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that\nbypassed dark energy [A&A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension\nwithout requiring a dynamical dark energy component.",

It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid\napproximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and\nbreaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the\nunitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics\non the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent\nviolations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation\noccurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale)\ncompared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for\ncorrecting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range\nphysics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are\ncoupled by the long-range potential.",

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an\nagent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states\ndepicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate\nvision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map\nimage states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often\nexpensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar\nto the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to\ndirectly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in\nthe embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for\nexploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action\ngeneration in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve\ncomplex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels,\nor segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero,\n6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual\nNavigation.

Plug-and-play approaches that\nalternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a\ndata-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly\niterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability\nchallenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable\nultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy.\nR2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively\nestimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data\nresidual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the\nMatching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially\ntrained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D\nmulti-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled\nradial k-space sampling.

By permanently deactivating the\nspecific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a\nzero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target\nconcepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without\nrequiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity\nidentities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's\neffectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal\nconcept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial\nprompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.",
