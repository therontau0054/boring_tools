            "summary": "We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\\beta^2 > 0$,\nand its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing\na physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and\nestablishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative\nGaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic\nsine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\\beta^2 = 2\\pi$. The\ndeterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear\nestimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. Moreover, the\nprobabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian\nmultiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time\nlight cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\\beta^2 = 6\\pi$ as a\ncritical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite\nsurprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold\nat $\\beta^2 =8\\pi$.",

The\norder of this sphere can be computed by knowing the possible values of the\nEuler characteristic of $\\xi$-manifolds. We are thus led to address two key\nquestions: the existence of $\\xi$-manifolds with odd Euler characteristic of a\ngiven dimension and conditions for the exact sequence to admit a splitting. We\nresolve these questions in a wide range of cases.\n  $\\mathrm{SKK}$ groups are of interest in physics as they play a role in the\nclassification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories,\nwhich classify anomalies and symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of\nmatter.

We develop the formalism for\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations\n$SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum\nTheory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of\nprobability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of\ngeometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After\nintroducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe\nnear-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that\nprobability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic\nuncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature\ntranslates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align\ntheir reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged\nqubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.",

For the\nfirst time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into\nthe modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement\nbetween the predicted and measured line profiles.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with\nfine-grained facial expressions. Our approach fine-tunes a state-of-the-art\ntext-to-image diffusion model to synthesize highly detailed and expressive\nfacial expressions. We then incorporate a stylization model that transforms\nthese realistic faces into cartoon avatars while preserving both identity and\nexpression. Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive\ncartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135\nfine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars\nwith a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We\ndemonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL.

            "summary": "Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling\ngraph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a\ngreat challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to\ndetect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD\nnode-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in\npractice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data\nsynthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable\nDiffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data,\nas well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available\nfor graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD\ndetection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD\nexposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process\nemploys a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent\ngenerative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from\nan evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately\nclassify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID\nembeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach\nimplicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances\nrelative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios\nwithout auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on\nfive benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD\nwithout using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and\nnon-exposure baselines.",
