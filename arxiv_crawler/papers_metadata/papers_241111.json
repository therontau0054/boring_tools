            "summary": "We introduce a nonstabilizerness monotone which we name basis-minimised\nstabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of $G$-asymmetry, a\nmeasure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect\nto a symmetry group $G$. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong\nmonotone for magic-state resource theory, while it can be extended to mixed\nstates via the convex roof construction. We discuss its relation with other\nmagic monotones, first showing that the BMSA coincides with the recently\nintroduced basis-minimized measurement entropy, thereby establishing the strong\nmonotonicity of the latter. Next, we provide inequalities between the BMSA and\nother nonstabilizerness measures known in the literature. Finally, we present\nnumerical methods to compute the BMSA, highlighting its advantages and\ndrawbacks compared to other nonstabilizerness measures in the context of pure\nmany-body quantum states. We also discuss the importance of additivity and\nstrong monotonicity for measures of nonstabilizerness in many-body physics,\nmotivating the search for additional computable nonstabilizerness monotones.",

This paper studies assembly sequence planning\n(ASP) for physical combinatorial assembly. Given the shape of the desired\nobject, the goal is to find a sequence of actions for placing unit primitives\nto build the target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned\nassembly sequence is physically executable. However, ASP for combinatorial\nassembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To\naddress the challenge, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a\nconstruction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the\ndesired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask\nthat filters out invalid actions, which effectively guides policy learning and\nensures violation-free deployment. In the end, we apply the proposed method to\nLego assembly with more than 250 3D structures. The experiment results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method plans physically valid assembly sequences\nto build all structures, achieving a $100\\%$ success rate, whereas the best\ncomparable baseline fails more than $40$ structures.

            "summary": "In combustion theory, flames are usually described in terms of the dynamics\nof iso-surfaces of a specific scalar. The flame displacement speed is then\nintroduced as a local variable quantifying the progression of these\niso-surfaces relative to the flow field. While formally defined as a scalar,\nthe physical meaning of this quantity allows relating it with a vector pointing\nalong the normal direction of the scalar iso-surface. In this work, this\none-dimensional concept is extended by the introduction of a generalized flame\ndisplacement velocity vector, which is associated with the dynamics of\niso-surfaces of two generic scalars, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. It is then shown how\na new flamelet paradigm can be built around this velocity vector, which leads\nto a very compact and generic set of two-dimensional flamelet equations for\nthermochemical quantities and the conditioning scalar gradients, $g_{\\alpha} =\n\\lvert \\nabla \\alpha \\rvert$ and $g_{\\beta} = \\lvert \\nabla \\beta \\rvert$. The\nmost important features of the developed framework are discussed in the context\nof partially-premixed flames, which provides significant insights into several\naspects of the theory, including the nature of the different contributions to\nthe flamelet equations for the conditioning scalar gradients and the fact that\ndifferent flamelet coordinate systems (orthogonal and non-orthogonal) can be\ncharacterized by the same flame displacement velocity vector. This approach\nopens an entire spectrum of possibilities for the definition of new\ntwo-dimensional composition spaces, which represents a very promising basis for\nthe development of new variants of flamelet theory.",

The acceleration of the PIC method has thus become a topic of high\ninterest, with several approaches having been pursued to this end. Among these,\nthe concept of reduced-order (RO) PIC simulations, first introduced in 2023,\nprovides a uniquely flexible and computationally efficient framework for\nkinetic plasma modelling - characteristics verified extensively in various\nplasma configurations. In this two-part article, we report the latest progress\nachieved on RO-PIC. Part I article revisits the original RO-PIC formulation and\nintroduces refinements that substantially enhance the cost-efficiency and\naccuracy of the method. We discuss these refinements in comparison against the\noriginal formulation, illustrating the progression to a \"first-order\"\nimplementation from the baseline \"zeroth-order\" one. In a detailed step-by-step\nverification, we first test the newly updated reduced-dimension Poisson solver\n(RDPS) in the first-order RO-PIC against its zeroth-order counterpart using\ntest-case Poisson problems. Next, comparing against the zeroth-order version,\nwe examine the performance of the complete first-order RO-PIC code in\ntwo-dimensional plasma problems.
