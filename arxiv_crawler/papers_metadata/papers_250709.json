            "summary": "Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain\nfundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective\nNonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing\nrelaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal\nmapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed\nthermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or\nnewly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that\nintegrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a\nsimplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient\nto overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively\naccurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers.\nRather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it\nby trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability\nin high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data.\nMoreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal\nmapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our\nresults establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy\npolymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials\ndiscovery.",

When topological flat bands possess concentrated quantum\ngeometry, a topological heavy fermion (THF) model was proposed as the starting\npoint to describe the interacting moir\\'e physics. In this work, we propose a\ndesign principle for realizing \"ideal\" THF model, which can host an exact flat\nband with \"ideal quantum geometry\", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric\nequals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moir\\'e\nheterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moir\\'e\nChern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands\ncan be realized in this model when the moir\\'e superlattice potential is\nstronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map\nthis model into a THF model that consists of a localized orbital for\n\"f-electron\" and a conducting band for \"c-electron\". We find that both the\nflatness and quantum geometry of the mini-bands in this THF model depend on the\nenergy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\\Gamma$ which is\nexperimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will\nallow us to realize an \"ideal\" topological flat band with zero band-width and\n\"ideal quantum geometry\" in this THF model. Our design strategy of topological\nflat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material\ncandidates for moir\\'e heterostructures with type-II band alignment.",

The detection\nprinciple is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators:\npolyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this\nfield of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup\nallows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm\ncube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise\nlocalisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an\nantineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a\npowerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of\nthe signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled\nto photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with\nhorizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in\nwhich a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy\ndeposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per\nfibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring\ndetection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached.\nThe paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale.\nThe first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to\naround 10\\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such\nmuons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is\nproposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process\nand provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD\npositron spectrum).

This paper develops a \\emph{homothetic gauge theory} (HGT)\nthat elevates local scale transformations to a genuine gauge symmetry, placing\nthem within the same geometric framework as conventional interactions. We\nintroduce a novel mathematical structure based on an extended vector bundle\nthat linearizes the action of local scaling, allowing for the definition of a\nhomothetic connection and a corresponding gauge-covariant field strength. When\nthis formalism is applied to classical U(1) electromagnetism, the theory yields\na generalized field-strength tensor that naturally incorporates both the\nstandard Maxwell field and a new scalar partner field governing the local\nscale. The resulting dynamics, including modified conservation laws and wave\nequations, are shown to be fully consistent. As a significant physical\napplication, this framework provides a compelling resolution to the classical\nproblem of the infinite self-energy of a point charge. By modeling the source\nas a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition on a shrinking interface, we\nconstruct a non-singular electrostatic potential, thereby removing the\ndivergence in a natural, geometric manner without introducing ad-hoc\nregularization schemes. The emergence of penalty terms due to essentially\ngeometric transformations promises a physically meaningful theory, and\nencourages to re-examining the role of scale invariance in other areas of\nclassical and quantum field theory.",

Existing diffusion models are adept at creating\nimages from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time\ninteraction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios\ninvolving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and\nbroadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present\na novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the\nbatching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional\nwait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To\nhandle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we\ndesign a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process.\nMoreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG),\nwhich requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant\ncomputations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG)\nalgorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to\nonly one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity\nfilter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around\n1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising\nlevels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the\nconventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature\nacceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps\non one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers\nover 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly\nreduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one\nRTX4090, respectively.",

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell.
