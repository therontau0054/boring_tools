Humans interact\nconstantly with the physical world, yet this rich data resource remains largely\nuntapped in robot learning. We propose EgoZero, a minimal system that learns\nrobust manipulation policies from human demonstrations captured with Project\nAria smart glasses, $\\textbf{and zero robot data}$. EgoZero enables: (1)\nextraction of complete, robot-executable actions from in-the-wild, egocentric,\nhuman demonstrations, (2) compression of human visual observations into\nmorphology-agnostic state representations, and (3) closed-loop policy learning\nthat generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy\nEgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot\ntransfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of\ndata collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can\nserve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way\ntoward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for\nrobots.

When qubits in one of the nodes are lost i.e. when the node\nis erased, the remaining nodes need to communicate with a new node to replace\nthe lost qubits. Here, we look at the problem of how much entanglement cost is\nneeded to perform such a distributed quantum erasure correction. We focus on\ndistributed quantum storage based on quantum maximum distance separable (MDS)\ncodes. We derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost when the quantum network\nused for the erasure correction has a star topology. We show that the simple\nmethod of downloading the non-erased qudits and performing operations at a\nsingle node is optimal when the minimal number of non-erased nodes are\naccessed. It remains to be seen what the entanglement cost will be when a\nnon-minimal number of non-erased nodes are accessed. The techniques used in\nthis work can be developed further to study the entanglement cost of quantum\nerasure correction in more general code families and network topologies.",

Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the\nwave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex\nprobability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real\nforward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two\nquasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the\nBorn rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability\nsets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for\nexplaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that\nproduces this so-called \"wave-like\" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective\nalso challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental\nconcept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of\nquantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of\nstochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the\nappearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum\nbehavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a\nprobabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic\nhidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight\ninto the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for\na novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.",

An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k)\nand E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic\nlimits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and\n0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals\nwith exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy\nof 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and\narchitecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced\nphysics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader\ncollaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise.

            "summary": "Quantum error correction is the art of protecting fragile quantum information\nthrough suitable encoding and active interventions. After encoding $k$ logical\nqubits into $n>k$ physical qubits using a stabilizer code, this amounts to\nmeasuring stabilizers, decoding syndromes, and applying an appropriate\ncorrection. Although quantum information can be protected in this way, it is\nnotoriously difficult to manipulate encoded quantum data without introducing\nuncorrectable errors. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for\nconstructing hardware-tailored quantum circuits that implement any desired\nClifford unitary on the logical level of any given stabilizer code. Our main\ncontribution is the formulation of this task as a discrete optimization\nproblem. We can explicitly integrate arbitrary hardware connectivity\nconstraints. As a key feature, our framework naturally incorporates an\noptimization over all Clifford gauges (differing only in their action outside\nthe code space) of a desired logical circuit. In this way, we find, for\nexample, fault-tolerant and teleportation-free logical Hadamard circuits for\nthe $[[8,3,2]]$ code. From a broader perspective, we turn away from the\nstandard generator decomposition approach and instead focus on the holistic\ncompilation of entire logical circuits, leading to significant savings in\npractice.

These machines consist of a\nnetwork of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the\noptimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are\ntransformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to\nharness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this\ntransformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more\ncomplex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely\nimpacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin\ninteractions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce\nthe exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class\nof multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to\nillustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology\nachieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine\nlearning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing\nIsing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering\nwith our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50%\ncompared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a\n1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up\nto 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the\nnumber of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising\nmachines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all\nmetrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution\nquality.

Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the\ntextual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the\nmasked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the\nsubject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a\npretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via\ndual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head \"latent feature shifting\"\nwithin each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect\nthe desired subject semantics and inter-head \"attention reweighting\" across\ndifferent heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential\nattention prioritization.

However, these\nmodifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of\nmeasurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct\nerrors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization\nand/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions\nfor achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these\nconditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only\nenforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion\nconsistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed\nstep-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains\na diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at\nevery sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly),\nour sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to\nour method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM).
