            "summary": "Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for\nenabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven\napproaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and\nsystem trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially\nimportant for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal\nloads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear\nor misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to\ndegradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and\nremaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a\nphysics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts\ninternal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this\nmesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode\ninteractions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an\nequivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction\nforces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware\niterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture\ninfluence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller\nbearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling\nelements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler\nGraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting\nloads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering\nstable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation.\nAchieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining\ncomparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital\ntwins, design, and maintenance.",

            "summary": "Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a\nvisual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by\nneurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of\nphotoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent\ninteractions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral\ngeniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently\nlinked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing\napparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the\nconceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link\nis between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship\nbetween color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first\ntime by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The\nmain purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model\nthat, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to\nexplain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception\nphenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic\nconsiderations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color\nperception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that\nsummarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the\nframework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile\ntrichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic\nproperties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or\nexperimental assumption.",

Although\nthere is recent work that characterizes introductory QISE courses, there is no\nholistic picture of the landscape of QISE and quantum-related education in the\nUnited States. We analyzed course catalogs from 1,456 U.S. institutions. We\nfound 61 institutions offering QISE degree programs, mostly at PhD-granting\nschools, with physics, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and computer\nscience(CS) as their primary contributors . Across all institutions, we\nidentified over 8,000 courses mentioning 'quantum,' but about one-third of\ninstitutions in our study had none. We also found over 500 dedicated QISE\ncourses, concentrated in PhD-granting institutions, primarily in physics, ECE,\nand CS. Physics leads in offering both general quantum-related ($\\sim$4,700)\nand QISE-specific ($\\sim$200) courses. Across multiple disciplines, we see that\nQISE topics are being introduced in courses not fully dedicated to QISE, which\nmay be a productive strategy for increasing access to QISE education. Our\ndataset and analysis provide the most comprehensive overview to date of quantum\neducation across US higher education.

However, their high computational demands often exceed a single\nUAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the\nlimited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots\n(GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling\nthrough UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide\ncomputing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the\nmulti-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration\noptimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective\nis to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring\nsystem stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov\noptimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability\nconstraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an\nalgorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a\ngenerative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy\ngradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a\nmethod for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting\nwith the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment\ndecisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation.
