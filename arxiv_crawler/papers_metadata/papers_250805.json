            "summary": "The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in\nstrongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics.\nHigh-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily\ntunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a\nsimple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to\ncapture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate\nsolutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate\ncorrelation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust\nsuperconductivity in moir\\'e WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be\ndescribed by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform\nfor tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moir\\'e WSe2 bilayers to the\nmoderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram\naround one hole per moir\\'e unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and\nelectrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of\nhigh-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1,\nsuperconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic\nstates at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc\noccurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective\nFermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on\ntransition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\\'e superlattices that can be used to\nstudy high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.",

These\nphases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected\ntopological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs --\ntopological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence.\nUnlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require\nexact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as\nthe symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state\nensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state\nconstruction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this\ngeneralized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases,\nand the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the\nconstraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a\nphysically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial\nsymmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our\nclassification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as\nan independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline\ntopological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections,\nand they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected\nphases that have no analog in clean systems.",

The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix\nNumerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for\nsolving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of\ncoupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is\napplied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing\ntraining samples (\"snapshots\") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for\ncomputationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy\napproach requires much fewer snapshot calculations.

By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical\nnotion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct\nmeaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the\nhuman-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,\nanimism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its\nunique characteristics.

To address this problem, we propose D2PPO\n(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces\ndispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating\nall hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs.

Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the\ntarget image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication\nonto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent\nwatermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise.\nYet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely\non searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic\ninformation about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a\ndistortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of\nkey patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic\nembedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore,\nconditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves\nrobustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two\nlargely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial\nnoise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker\ninserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image,\npossibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's\nincreased robustness to these attacks.

FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of\nheterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and\nadvanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment.\nLeveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800\nmillion financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key\nfinancial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and\nreinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based\nfinetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that\nFinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent\nbenchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation\nfor future research and real-world applications.

            "summary": "Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a\ncritical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust\nmarket simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often\nconstrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern\ndeep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that\naffect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through\ndiscretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,\na novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB\nevents. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte\nprediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed\nbinary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core\nnovelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and\ntokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most\nfundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,\na hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to\ndiscover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.\nOur primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework\nfor LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a\ncomprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million\nevents from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized\nfacts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,\nheavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that\nlearning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm\nfor modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on\nstandard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.",

            "authors": "Alejandro Rodriguez Dominguez",
            "summary": "Recent claims in financial modeling argue that causal identifiability is\nnecessary for valid portfolio optimization, asserting that misspecified models\nlead to signal inversion and degraded performance. This paper challenges that\nassertion by showing that structurally misspecified predictive models, those\nomitting confounders or misrepresenting functional relationships, can still\nsupport robust and efficient portfolio construction. We develop a theoretical\nframework linking optimization performance to the directional alignment between\npredictive signals and true expected returns, independent of structural\ncorrectness. We derive sufficient conditions under which even non-causal\nsignals yield valid, convex efficient frontiers, and we show that the Sharpe\nratio scales linearly with alignment. Analytical results are supported by\nsimulation studies demonstrating robustness to confounding and miscalibration,\nincluding cases of approximate bias cancellation. Empirical experiments using\nstock returns confirm that associational signals can produce viable frontiers\nunder classical mean-variance optimization. These findings reframe the role of\ncausal modeling in quantitative finance: while causality may offer\ninterpretability and robustness in specific contexts, it is directional\ninformativeness, not structural fidelity, that is essential for effective\nsignal-based portfolio design.",

            "summary": "We propose the Financial Connectome, a new scientific discipline that models\nfinancial markets through the lens of brain functional architecture. Inspired\nby the foundational work of group independent component analysis (groupICA) in\nneuroscience, we reimagine markets not as collections of assets, but as\nhigh-dimensional dynamic systems composed of latent market modules. Treating\nstocks as functional nodes and their co-fluctuations as expressions of\ncollective cognition, we introduce dynamic Market Network Connectivity (dMNC),\nthe financial analogue of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC). This\nbiologically inspired framework reveals structurally persistent market\nsubnetworks, captures regime shifts, and uncovers systemic early warning\nsignals all without reliance on predictive labels. Our results suggest that\nmarkets, like brains, exhibit modular, self-organizing, and temporally evolving\narchitectures. This work inaugurates the field of financial connectomics, a\nprincipled synthesis of systems neuroscience and quantitative finance aimed at\nuncovering the hidden logic of complex economies.",
