            "summary": "It is quite common to use the generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) as\ngeneric models to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles and to\ngain a better understanding of the probabilistic or information theoretic\nfoundations of quantum physics and quantum computing. A variety of symmetry\npostulates was introduced and studied in this framework, including the\ntransitivity of the automorphism group (1) on the pure states, (2) on the pairs\nof orthogonal pure states [these pairs are called 2-frames] and (3) on any\nframes of the same size. The second postulate is M\\\"uller and Ududec's bit\nsymmetry, which they motivate by quantum computational needs. Here we explore\nthese three postulates in the transition probability framework, which is more\nspecific than the GPTs since the existence of the transition probabilities for\nthe quantum logical atoms is presupposed either directly or indirectly via a\ncertain geometric property of the state space. This property for compact convex\nsets was introduced by the author in a recent paper. We show that bit symmetry\nimplicates the symmetry of the transition probabilities between the atoms.\nUsing a result by Barnum and Hilgert, we can then conclude that the third\nrather strong symmetry postulate rules out all models but the classical cases\nand in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.",

While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for\nsimpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g.,\nthe object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when\nhandling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce\nDexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive\ndexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through\na dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact\nalignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive\ngeneralizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics\nmodel-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated\nguidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical\ninteractions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues.\nExperiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block\nre-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on\ngoals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success\nrate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves\n70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block\nhalf-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive,\nhighlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.",

The Bethe\nlogarithms associated with these exclusive reactions are found to have rather\ndifferent traits from those associated with Lamb shift. We present numerical\npredictions by employing several influential quark potential models.

This investigation is\nperformed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\\\"odinger\nquantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the\nspeed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical\ntrajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from\na classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric\ncomplexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on\ncurved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only\npartial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic\nquantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the\ncomplexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity\nlength scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both\nquantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e.,\ntotal) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the\nquantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Third, after\ncalculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one\nof the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with\nthat of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the\ncurvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions\nare less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that\ncomplexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent\ncan exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a\nsmaller curvature coefficient.",

The chiral\nphonon has been proposed to be involved in various physical phenomena, but it\nis not yet well defined mathematically. Here we examine two approaches for\nassigning and quantifying the chirality of molecular normal modes in\ndouble-helical molecular wires with various levels of twist. First, associating\nwith each normal mode a structure obtained by imposing the corresponding motion\non a common atomic origin, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to\nquantitatively assess the relationship between the chirality-weighted normal\nmode spectrum and the chirality of the underlying molecular structure. We find\nthat increasing the amount of twist in the double helix shifts the mean normal\nmode CCM to drastically higher values, implying that the chirality of molecular\nnormal modes is strongly correlated with that of the underlying molecular\nstructure. Second, we assign to each normal mode a pseudoscaler defined as the\nproduct of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms, and we\nanalyze the handedness of the normal mode spectrum with respect to this\nquantity. We find that twisting the double-chain structure introduces asymmetry\nbetween right and left-handed normal modes so that in twisted structures\ndifferent frequency bands are characterized by distinct handedness. This may\ngive rise to global phenomena such as thermal chirality.",
