            "summary": "The neutrino telescopes have firmly established the existence of\nultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos offer a\nunique probe of neutrino self-interactions. This work investigates how the\nself-interacting neutrinos, mediated by scalar bosons, inject energy into the\nmedium through radiative scattering with the cosmic neutrino background,\nleaving an imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The\nenergy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\\times10^4\\lesssim\nz\\lesssim2\\times10^6$ and $ z\\lesssim5\\times10^4$, leads to $\\mu$-type and\n$y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively. Using observational\nconstraints from Cosmic Background Explorer/Far Infrared Absolute\nSpectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) and projected sensitivities from Primordial\nInflation Explorer (PIXIE) experiments for $\\mu$-type and $y$-type CMB\ndistortions, we derive the stringent upper bounds on the self-interaction\ncoupling strength as a function of mediator mass for neutrino interactions. We\nfocus on flavor-specific self-interaction related to muon neutrinos and sub-GeV\nmass mediators ($m_{\\phi}$). We find the upper bound on the self-interaction\ncoupling strength to be $\\sim 3.1\\times 10^{-5}$ for the muon neutrino,\nconsidering UHE muon neutrino energy to be 1 PeV and PIXIE projected upper\nbounds on $\\mu$-type CMB spectral distortion. The bound remains constant till\nthe mediator mass reaches the center of mass energy, and after that, it gets\nrelaxed and becomes proportional to the mediator mass. We have also compared\nour results with existing bounds in the literature. Our findings indicate that\nCMB spectral distortion could play a decisive role in exploring neutrino\nphysics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and future missions like\nPIXIE can provide valuable insights.",

We identify the physical origins of these\ntransitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy\nexchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark\nshifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to\nthe circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the\ndrive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while\ntransferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level\nsystem (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation,\ncomplemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device,\naccurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS.

            "summary": "Wave interference has historically relied on scattering objects placed within\nthe wave domain. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new mechanism: scatterless\ninterference induced by a lattice of subsurface phonon motion beneath a smooth\nwall interfacing with a transitioning boundary-layer flow. The subsurface\nconsists of a wall-parallel lattice of wall-normal frequency-dependent phononic\nstructural units, each designed to respond to local flow perturbations in an\nout-of-phase manner, suppressing them at the point of interaction.\nCollectively, the lattice induces interference effects that cause the kinetic\nenergy of flow instabilities to decay downstream, thereby delaying\nlaminar-to-turbulent transition. To guide the design of the phononic subsurface\nlattice, a Bloch-wave unit-cell analysis is developed for the flow\nperturbations, and direct numerical simulations validate the concept. This work\nestablishes scatterless interference as a distinct physical phenomenon and\nrepresents a paradigm shift in the design of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic\nsurfaces--moving beyond streamlined shaping to leveraging subsurface phonon\nengineering for drag reduction and enhanced performance.",

            "summary": "Human mobility in cities is shaped not only by visible structures such as\nhighways, rivers, and parks but also by invisible barriers rooted in\nsocioeconomic segregation, uneven access to amenities, and administrative\ndivisions. Yet identifying and quantifying these barriers at scale and their\nrelative importance on people's movements remains a major challenge. Neural\nembedding models, originally developed for language, offer a powerful way to\ncapture the complexity of human mobility from large-scale data. Here, we apply\nthis approach to 25.4 million observed trajectories across 11 major U.S.\ncities, learning mobility embeddings that reveal how people move through urban\nspace. These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places,\none that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to\ndetect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but\nbehaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these\nbarriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and\nresidential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are\nconcentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time\nperiods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary\nbut still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that\nindividuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting\nhours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and\nhigher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial,\nsocial, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a\nscalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications\nin planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis.",

We show that the Zak phase, representing the\ngeometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using\na phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding\nnumber. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the\ndefect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence.

            "summary": "Constructing the Implied Volatility Surface (IVS) is a challenging task in\nquantitative finance due to the complexity of real markets and the sparsity of\nmarket data. Structural models like Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho (SABR) model\noffer interpretability and theoretical consistency but lack flexibility, while\npurely data-driven methods such as Gaussian Process regression can struggle\nwith sparse data. We introduce SABR-Informed Multi-Task Gaussian Process\n(SABR-MTGP), treating IVS construction as a multi-task learning problem. Our\nmethod uses a dense synthetic dataset from a calibrated SABR model as a source\ntask to inform the construction based on sparse market data (the target task).\nThe MTGP framework captures task correlation and transfers structural\ninformation adaptively, improving predictions particularly in data-scarce\nregions. Experiments using Heston-generated ground truth data under various\nmarket conditions show that SABR-MTGP outperforms both standard Gaussian\nprocess regression and SABR across different maturities. Furthermore, an\napplication to real SPX market data demonstrates the method's practical\napplicability and its ability to produce stable and realistic surfaces. This\nconfirms our method balances structural guidance from SABR with the flexibility\nneeded for market data.",
