            "summary": "General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared\nregime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics\ngenerically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary.\nOne route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion,\nnon-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard\n(ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing\nGravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations\nsuch as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16\nand PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful\ntheory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are\nalso phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the\ncombined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in\nthe vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the\nleading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory\nas $m\\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes.\nBy contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential\nand GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\\alpha_1$ and\n$\\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations\nput mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For\nexample, if we assume $\\alpha_1\\simeq\\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain\n$\\alpha_{1,2}\\lesssim 4.2\\times 10^{83}$ for $m\\sim 3\\times\n10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\alpha_{1,2}\\lesssim 1.3\\times 10^{75}$ for $m\\sim\n10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first\nastrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order\ngravity.",

However, being the subject of investigation by different\nscientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools,\nthe connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to\nthermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental\ndifference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and\nthe thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe\nphysics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out\nnumerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic\nlead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity\nphysics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this\nmodel on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find\nthat while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated\nthermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the\nnon-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body\ninteraction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find\nthat this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in\nthe same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with\nreversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.",

In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase\nwith thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML\nmodel trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the\ndynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we\ndevelop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical\nknowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical\nInformation-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics\nloss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV\nand SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the\ndaily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of\nsamples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and\nearly freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.",

The conditions allow us to determine the lattice constant and\nfrequency values that enable the formation of the axisymmetric BIC due to the\ndestructive interference of radiation from zonal multipole moments of a certain\nparity, although each moment radiates individually. By employing the T-matrix\nmethod for acoustic metasurfaces, we numerically investigate the BIC resonance\nin various structures, including finite arrays, and also the transformation of\nsuch resonances into high-$Q$ quasi-BIC regimes, which can be excited by a\nplane wave at normal incidence.",
