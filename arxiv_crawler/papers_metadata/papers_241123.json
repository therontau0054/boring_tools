Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses\nfrom nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra,\nsupporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse\ncompressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to\ncontrol the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been\nlimited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise.\nHere, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-trained convolutional neural\nnetwork (P-CNN) can circumvent such challenges, showing few-fold speedups over\nthe direct approaches. We highlight three key advancements enabled by the P-CNN\napproach: (i) on-demand control over spectral features of SC, (ii) direct\ngeneration of sub-3-cycle pulses from the highly nonlinear fiber, and (iii) the\nproduction of high-order solitons, capturing distinct \"breather\" dynamics in\nboth spectral and temporal domains. This approach heralds a new era of\narbitrary spectro-temporal state engineering, with transformative implications\nfor ultrafast and quantum science.",

However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches,\nthe fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact\nresults have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of\nthe physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles,\ntaking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in\none-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic\narguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in\nparticular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these\nprinciples, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of\nthermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the\nstructure of hydrodynamic modes. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable\nmodels with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model\nfor cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in\nfact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while\nlong-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and\nnon-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is\nexpected to give all cumulants.",

In some cases,\ntaking information-gathering actions such as additional measurements or control\ninputs given to the system can help resolve uncertainty and determine the most\naccurate hypothesis. The task of optimizing these actions can be formulated as\na belief-space Markov decision process that we call a hypothesis-driven belief\nMDP. Unfortunately, this problem suffers from the curse of history similar to a\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To plan in continuous\ndomains, an agent needs to reason over countlessly many possible\naction-observation histories, each resulting in a different belief over the\nunknown state. The problem is exacerbated in the hypothesis-driven context\nbecause each action-observation pair spawns a different belief for each\nhypothesis, leading to additional branching. This paper considers the case in\nwhich each hypothesis corresponds to a different dynamic model in an underlying\nPOMDP. We present a new belief MDP formulation that: (i) enables reasoning over\nmultiple hypotheses, (ii) balances the goals of determining the (most likely)\ncorrect hypothesis and performing well in the underlying POMDP, and (iii) can\nbe solved with sparse tree search.",

We extract high-distance\ndoubly even codes from the quantum quadratic-residue code family that admit a\ntransversal implementation of the single-qubit Clifford group and block\ntransversal implementation of the full Clifford group. Applying a doubling\nprocedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields a family of high-distance\nweak triply even codes which admit a transversal implementation of the logical\n$\\texttt{T}$-gate. Relaxing the triply even property, we also obtain a family\nof triorthogonal codes which requires an even lower overhead at the cost of\nadditional Clifford gates to achieve the same logical operation. To our\nknowledge, our doubly even and triorthogonal families are the shortest qubit\nstabilizer codes of the same distance that can realize their respective gates.",

This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the\nabsence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related\nconsiderations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced\nmachine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have\nattracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community.\nFurthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent\nelastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and\nelastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this\npaper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (physics of the problem)\nand integrating it with machine learning techniques, we propose methods for the\nsolution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven\nand physics-based approaches.

This letter shows that the generated\ngenuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys\nto securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message\nencryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way\nSPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like\nintercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental\nrealization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of\nfreedom being OAM, path, and polarization.

Therefore, we propose an\nautomatic method to identify \"vital layers\" within DiT, crucial for image\nformation, and demonstrate how these layers facilitate a range of controlled\nstable edits, from non-rigid modifications to object addition, using the same\nmechanism.
