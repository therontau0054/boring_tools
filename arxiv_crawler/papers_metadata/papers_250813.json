By modeling the effective electric field induced by\nthe decay photons, we evaluate the response of quantum sensors across two\nparticle physics scenarios: the cosmic neutrino background and two-component\ndark matter. We assess the discovery potential of these devices and outline the\nparameter space accessible under current experimental capabilities. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that quantum sensors can probe radiative decays of dark\nmatter candidates using existing technology, while probing neutrino magnetic\nmoments beyond current limits will require scalable quantum architectures with\nenhanced coherence.",

In this work, we present\nColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention\nmechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By\ndisentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention\nmaps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color\nediting, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method\nmodifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated\nareas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate\nthat ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.\nFurthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1\nKontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended\nto video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,\nparticularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,\nour method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such\nas Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.",

In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry\nexperiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is\nconnected to strong field physics and attosecond science.

This situation raises the question whether\nthe simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact,\nthe two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary\nevolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the\ninfinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the\ngeneralized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite\nexcitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we\npresent results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to\neven and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different\nself-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To\nmake the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize\nit by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental\nimplementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the\nHamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the\nparity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed\nrenders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.",

We compute the \"virtual thermodynamic potential\" and show that it\nsatisfies a modified quantum statistical relation that is compatible with the\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics supplemented with an extra term,\ninterpreted as virtual work in previous literature. The novelty is that, within\nour formalism, we can explicitly compute this term as the first derivative of\nthe virtual thermodynamic potential with respect to the horizon radius that is\nconsidered as the order parameter. Imposing the physical condition that the\nfirst derivative vanishes is at the basis of the matching between the first law\nof black hole thermodynamics and (one of the) Einstein equations evaluated at\nthe horizon. Interestingly, imposing the physical conditions that the second\nand third derivatives vanish, we can concretely study the criticality and\nexistence of swallow tails. As a specific example, we apply this formalism to\nan exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the\ngeneralized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is\nincluded, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial\ncritical behaviour corresponding to an inverted swallowtail.",

However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such\ncomplex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under\nand following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively\ncaptured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and\ncalibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for\nPredicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict\nboth the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block\nlevel under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.\nGuided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory\nguides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation\ndynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention\nmodule for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a\nregularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs\nsignificantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial\nland use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%\nimprovement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided\nmodules was further validated through ablation studies.

            "summary": "Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security\nconcern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods\nhave shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of\nhigh-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while\npublicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient\nreal-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich\nsemantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the\nfirst large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically\nsimulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse\nlogs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with\nagents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group\nmeetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic\norganizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP\ntheft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three\nsensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical\ninstitution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via\nhuman studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and\npresence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods\nshow an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the\nCERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for\nadvancing ITD research.",

            "authors": "Eckhard Platen, Kevin Fergusson",
            "summary": "The hypothesis that there do not exist free lunches with vanishing risk\n(FLVRs) in the real market underpins the popular risk-neutral pricing and\nhedging methodology in quantitative finance. The paper documents the fact that\nthis hypothesis can be safely rejected. It performs extremely accurately the\nhedging of an extreme-maturity zero-coupon bond (ZCB). This hedge is part of a\nportfolio that starts with zero initial wealth and invests dynamically in a\ntotal return stock market index and the savings account to generate at the\nmaturity date of the extreme-maturity ZCB a strictly positive amount with\nstrictly positive probability, which represents an FLVR. The fact that FLVRs\nnaturally exist in the real market can be accommodated theoretically under the\nbenchmark approach.",
