            "summary": "Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their\nstructure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.\nIn this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling\narticulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and\nphysically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D\nGaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable\nattributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve\nhigh-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a\nmotion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,\nincluding contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part\ncollisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving\nmotion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable\nparts.",

Since weak values provide empirical insights that cannot\nbe derived from expectation values, this paper explores what physical\nproperties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It\ndemonstrates that, in general, the time derivative of a gauge-invariant weak\nvalue is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant quantity. Two conditions\nare presented to ensure that the left- or right-time derivative of a weak value\nis also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under these conditions, a local\nEhrenfest-like theorem can be derived for weak values giving a natural\ninterpretation for the time derivative of weak values. Notably, a single\nmeasured weak value of the system's position provides information about two\nadditional unmeasured weak values: the system's local velocity and\nacceleration, through the first- and second-order time derivatives of the\ninitial weak value, respectively. These findings also offer guidelines for\nexperimentalists to translate the weak value theory into practical laboratory\nsetups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies.

This study estimates background-error covariances in a\nreduced-dimension latent space learned by a neural-network autoencoder (AE).\nThe AE was trained using 40 years of ERA5 reanalysis data, enabling it to\ncapture flow-dependent atmospheric balances from a diverse set of weather\nstates.\n  We demonstrate that performing DA in the latent space yields analysis\nincrements that preserve multivariate horizontal and vertical physical balances\nin both tropical and midlatitude atmosphere. Assimilating a single 500 hPa\ngeopotential height observation in the midlatitudes produces increments\nconsistent with geostrophic and thermal wind balance, while assimilating a\ntotal column water vapor observation with a positive departure in the\nnearly-saturated tropical atmosphere generates an increment resembling the\ntropical response to (latent) heat-induced perturbations. The resulting\nincrements are localized and flow-dependent, and shaped by orography and\nland-sea contrasts.

Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for\npredicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex\nmicrostructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional\nnumerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive,\nespecially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing\nlearning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and\ngeneralization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present\nCGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for\nsolving homogenization problems. CGINS leverages sparse and periodic 3D\nconvolution to enable high-resolution learning while ensuring structural\nperiodicity. It features a multi-level network architecture that facilitates\neffective learning across different scales and employs minimum potential energy\nas label-free loss functions for self-supervised learning. The integrated\npreconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides\nPCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy.\nAdditionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical\nconsistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on\nDirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies\nand material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative\nerror below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and\nGPU-accelerated numerical solvers.
