            "summary": "Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool for data analysis in particle\nphysics. Simulated events are typically produced alongside weights that\nredistribute the cross section across the phase space. Latent degrees of\nfreedom introduce a distribution of weights at a given point in the phase\nspace, which can include negative values. Several post-hoc reweighting methods\nhave been developed to eliminate the negative weights. All of these methods\nshare the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of\nphase space. We introduce an alternative approach with a potentially simpler\nlearning task. Instead of reweighting to the average, we refine the initial\nweights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent\nfactor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight\ndistribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase\nspace is processed using neural networks for the refinement. Using both\nrealistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method\nis able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations.",

            "summary": "Classical physics is often a good approximation for quantum systems composed\nof many interacting particles, although wavepacket dispersion and scattering\nprocesses continuously induce delocalization and entanglement. According to\ndecoherence theory, an entangled ensemble can appear classical when only a\nsubset of all particles is observed. This emergence of macroscopic phenomena\nfrom quantum interactions is, for example, relevant for phase transitions,\nquantum thermalization, hydrodynamics, spin liquids, or time crystals. However,\nentanglement and decoherence in free electrons have not yet been explored,\nalthough the electron is a fundamental elementary particle with extraordinary\ntechnological relevance. Here, we investigate the degree of coherence and\nentanglement in a free-space electron gas in the beam of an ultrafast electron\nmicroscope. Inspired by the strong interaction of free electrons with laser\nlight, we introduce a two-electron quantum walk that enables quantum state\ntomography of entangled or partially entangled electron-electron pairs. We\napply this novel diagnostic to study the creation and loss of entanglement in\nshort pulses of hundreds of electrons. We observe high-contrast two-electron\ninterferences and signs of small electron-electron entanglement that we explain\nby competition between entangling Coulomb interactions and decoherence effects\nfrom unmeasured reservoir electrons. The ability to characterize entangled\nfree-electron quantum states will provide insight into the emergence of\nclassical phenomena from quantum principles in the realm of particles with mass\nand charge, and will have practical applications in low-dose electron\nmicroscopy, ghost imaging, or quantum electron microscopy.",

However, HMC simulations often suffer from long\nautocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of\nthe main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first\nsource is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal\ndistribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic\nsolutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier\nacceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for\nnear-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results\nfor numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as\nwell as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by\nmultiple orders of magnitude.

Traditional sampling\nmethods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the\nhigh-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of\ntransitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in\nsimulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant\nprocesses - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein\nfrom its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial\nfor neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to\nseconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe\neven once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as\na continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP)\ngeneration. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and\nleveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics\nforce fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically\nrealistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling.

This argument finds that a\nfirewall would appear very late in a black hole's lifetime, when Hawking\nradiation has caused the horizon to shrink to one-half its original area. For\nstellar-mass black holes, this process surpasses the universe's current age and\nso no such black hole would currently possess a firewall. However, black holes\nhave recently been conjectured to scramble their interior degrees-of-freedom,\nwith a scrambling time scale comparable to the time it takes light to travel a\nSchwartzschild radius' distance. We prove that local observers will already\nexperience a firewall from the scrambling time onwards after the black hole's\nformation. Here `local' means that the observer couples to fewer than one-half\nthe black hole's total interior `qubits.' Indeed, for observers to fail to be\nlocal in this manner, it would mean that they couple to more `qubits' within\nsuch black holes than exist in all the stars of the observable universe.\nTherefore we find that if black holes are indeed fast scramblers, then every\nastrophysical black hole in the universe will already have a fully developed\nfirewall for any local physical process.",

In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional\nSpectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates\nthe advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address\nthese limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral\nscanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture\ncomprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra\nof deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure\nrecovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns\nfrom well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior\ncontaining correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions\nfor better detail restoration.

Yet, in practice, only a\nmoderate degree of memorization is observed, even without explicit\nregularization. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by uncovering an\nimplicit regularization mechanism driven by large learning rates. Specifically,\nwe show that in the small-noise regime, the empirical optimal score exhibits\nhigh irregularity. We then prove that, when trained by stochastic gradient\ndescent with a large enough learning rate, neural networks cannot stably\nconverge to a local minimum with arbitrarily small excess risk. Consequently,\nthe learned score cannot be arbitrarily close to the empirical optimal score,\nthereby mitigating memorization.
