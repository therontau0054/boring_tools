However, realizing and characterizing such\ntopologically nontrivial quantum critical states with large particle numbers\nremains an outstanding experimental challenge in statistical and condensed\nmatter physics. Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and\nmanipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for\nexploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental\nexploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying\ncritical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We\ndevelop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on\nprepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial\ntopology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the\nentanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold\ntopological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary\ncondition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence\nin topological critical systems. Our results demonstrate the low-lying critical\nstates as useful quantum resources for investigating the interplay between\ntopology and quantum criticality.",

            "summary": "The four-roll mill has been traditionally viewed as a device generating\nsimple extensional flow with a central stagnation point. Our systematic\ninvestigation using a two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann\n(TRT-RLB) model reveals unexpected richness in the flow physics, identifying\ntwo previously unreported supercritical bifurcation modes: a quadrifoliate\nvortex mode featuring four symmetrical counter-rotating vortices, and a\ndumbbell-shaped quad-vortex mode where vortices detach from but remain\nsymmetric about the stagnation point. The numerical framework, representing the\nfirst successful extension of TRT-RLB method to power-law fluid dynamics,\nenables comprehensive mapping of flow characteristics across Reynolds numbers\n($1 \\leq Re \\leq 50$), power-law indices ($0.7 \\leq n \\leq 1.3$), and geometric\nconfigurations. The transition from quadrifoliate vortex mode exhibits distinct\npathways depending on the power-law index: at relatively small $n$, the flow\nundergoes a direct supercritical bifurcation to simple extensional flow, while\nat relatively large $n$, it evolves through an intermediate dumbbell-shaped\nstate. Among geometric parameters, the roller radius $r$ emerges as the\ndominant factor controlling bifurcation points and vortex dimensions, whereas\nthe roller-container gap $\\delta$ exerts minimal influence on flow regimes. The\ntransitions between flow modes can be precisely characterized through the\nevolution of vortex dimensions and velocity gradients at the stagnation point,\nproviding quantitative criteria for flow regime identification. These findings\nenrich our fundamental understanding of bifurcation phenomena in extensional\ndevices and provide quantitative guidelines for achieving desired flow patterns\nin four-roll mill applications.",

In particular, we lift\nan ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and\nestablish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity.

For each initial condition, a\nray-tracing simulation is performed to evaluate the ECCD efficiency.\nUnfortunately, this approach often requires millions of simulations to build up\na dataset that adequately covers the plasma volume, which must then be repeated\nevery time the design point changes. Here we adopt a different approach. Rather\nthan launching rays from the plasma periphery and hoping for the best, we\ninstead directly reconstruct the optimal ray for driving current at a given\nflux surface using a reduced physics model coupled with a commercial\nray-tracing code. Repeating this throughout the plasma volume requires only\nhundreds of simulations, constituting a ten-thousand-fold speedup.

Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral\ndistributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional\nassumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra\nestimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three\ndistinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a\nmanifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution\ninternal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes\northogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of\nthe data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an\nelegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the\nmanifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the\ninternal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time\npoints during generation.",

A model for the\nforce balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above\ningredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow\nconsiderations.

However, state-of-the-art generalist robot\npolicies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions\nsolely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose\nFuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies\non heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily\navailable by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We\ncombine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language\ngeneration loss to encode high-level semantics.

We show that the same\nrecipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both\ndiffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA)\nmodels.
