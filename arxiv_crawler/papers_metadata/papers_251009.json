            "summary": "Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable\nenergy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding\nplasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital\nfor next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the\nnonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over\ntime. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often\nemployed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,\nthey omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we\nintroduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena\nneglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent\nheat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,\n(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent\n3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and\nthe distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation\ninspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely\nused reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy\ncascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three\norders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows\npromising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for\nscalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.",

            "summary": "Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of\ncontinuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical\nsystems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a\nfundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we\nefficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the\nperspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory,\ncharacterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of\nthe number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of\ncopies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then\nextend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies\nsuffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are\nfar. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states\nnecessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a\nfundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on\nrotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently\nintroduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.",

            "summary": "Heat transfer in fractured media is governed by the interplay between\nadvective transport along rough-walled fractures and conductive transport, both\nwithin the fractures and in the surrounding low-permeability matrix. Flow\nlocalization induced by aperture heterogeneity, combined with matrix\nconduction, gives rise to anomalous thermal behavior. To capture these effects,\nwe develop a stochastic modeling framework that couples a time-domain random\nwalk (TDRW) representation of advective and conductive transport in the\nfractures with a semi-analytical model of conductive heat exchange with the\nmatrix. Matrix trapping times follow a L\\'evy-Smirnov distribution derived from\nfirst-passage theory, capturing the heavy-tailed dynamics typical of fractured\nsystems. Heat flux at the fracture-matrix interface is computed via a nonlocal\nconvolution integral based on Duhamel's principle, accounting for thermal\nmemory effects. The model is validated against analytical benchmarks and\nfinite-element simulations. Monte Carlo simulations over stochastic aperture\nfields quantify the influence of fracture closure, correlation length, and\nP\\'eclet number. Results reveal a transition from superdiffusive to\nsubdiffusive regimes, driven by the competition between advective transport\nalong preferential paths, dispersion induced by aperture variability, and\nmatrix-driven heat conduction. In the long-time regime, heat exchange exhibits\na characteristic $t^{-1/2}$ decay. At early times, limited thermal penetration\ninto the matrix leads to weaker interfacial fluxes, underscoring the role of\nmatrix thermal inertia. The proposed framework enables physically consistent\nand computationally efficient simulations of thermal transport in complex\nfractured systems, with implications for geothermal energy, subsurface thermal\nstorage, and engineered heat exchange in low-permeability environments.",

While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the\nDavies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical\ngenerator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then\nthe two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a\nlarge class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed\nHamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains\nwithin a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with\nphysical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain\ntechniques to the quantum setting.\n  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the\nDavies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the\nHamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded\nin terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient.\nThus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full\nDavies generator.",

We introduce a class\nof codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge\nconnecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a\nrandom SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a\ntradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code\nparameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion\ncodes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\\sim Tn$ with\n$T> n^{2\\beta}$ for arbitrary $\\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the\nTanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up\nsize $\\delta \\sim \\sqrt T \\sim n^{\\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree.\nAt the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by\n$\\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this\nresult should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph\nproducts of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the\ntorus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same\nexpansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes.
