In this work, we describe a system\nthat uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning\nover complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step\nto fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In\ncontrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple\ncommands (\"pick up the cup\"), our system can reason through complex prompts and\nincorporate situated feedback during task execution (\"that's not trash\"). We\nevaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm,\ndual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks\nsuch as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.",

Today, AI has started to advance natural\nsciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural\nphenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new\narea of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging\nresearch paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly\ninterdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field\nis needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough\naccount of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and\ncontinuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the\nsubatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,\nmaterials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales\nand form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on\nthese areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby\nallowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to\ncapture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by\ndeep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of\ntechniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss\nother common technical challenges, including explainability,\nout-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and\nlarge language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning\nand education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be\nuseful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may\ntrigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.",

Starting from\ndifferent microscopic realizations of effectively chiral $(1+1)$-dimensional\ngeneralizations of the SYK model, we derive a reduction to the\nAlekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action\nwhich has been proposed as the effective boundary action of three-dimensional\ngravity. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around\nthe Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of\nthree-dimensional gravity. These two constructions allow us to match bulk and\nboundary coupling constants, and to compute observables. Specifically, we apply\nsemiclassical techniques inspired by condensed matter physics to the\ncomputation of out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), demonstrating\nmaximal chaos in the chiral SYK chain and its gravity dual.",

Different\nstacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature\ndistributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains\nsimilar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on\nthe quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\\circ$ twisted double\nbilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA)\nand forms an inversion broken \\moire superlattice with electrically tunable\nflat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking\norder, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in\nBerry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD\nexhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the\nperpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric\nbehavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity\nin AB-BA TDBG.
