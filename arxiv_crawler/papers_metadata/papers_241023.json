            "summary": "While visuomotor policy learning has advanced robotic manipulation, precisely\nexecuting contact-rich tasks remains challenging due to the limitations of\nvision in reasoning about physical interactions. To address this, recent work\nhas sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning. However, many\nexisting approaches rely on optical tactile sensors that are either restricted\nto recognition tasks or require complex dimensionality reduction steps for\npolicy learning. In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skin\nsensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, and\ninexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensors\neffectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach that\nuses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additional\ntokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasks\ninvolving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelf\nretrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactile\nsensing based policies. Further analysis reveals that combining tactile and\nvisual modalities enhances policy performance and spatial generalization,\nachieving an average improvement of 27.5% across tasks.\nhttps://visuoskin.github.io/",

            "summary": "The ZX calculus is a graphical language for representing and rewriting\nquantum circuits. While its graphical rewrite rules preserve semantics, they\nmay not preserve other features. For example, applying rewrites to a circuit\nthat implements an error-correcting code can change its distance. Here, we\ndefine the notion of distance-preserving rewrites that enables the\ntransformation of error-correcting codes without changing their distance. Using\nthese rewrites, we propose an algorithm that transforms a high-weight Pauli\nmeasurement into an equivalent quantum circuit with only single- and two-qubit\noperations. Since we only use distance-preserving rewrites, we guarantee that\nerrors in the low-weight implementation do not propagate to create multiple\ndata errors. Going further, we generalise the Floquetification procedure of\n[arXiv:2308.15489] to arbitrary stabiliser codes. Given a stabiliser code, we\nsynthesise a new quantum error-correcting code which encodes the same number of\nqubits with at least the same distance. The number of additional qubits this\nmethod requires is linearly dependent on the weight or the largest Pauli\nmeasurement. This creates a tradeoff between easily implementable low-weight\nPauli measurements at the cost of additional physical qubits.",

This methodology\ninvolves a sampling approach, where a subset of relevant configurations is\nchosen based on energy criteria, and a projection method is used to enhance the\naccuracy of wavefunction propagation while reducing computational cost. We\nevaluate this method through numerical simulations of a seven-qubit system,\ncalculating key physical observables such as state probabilities and\ndomain-wall densities. Our results indicate that while complete basis sets\noffer accurate dynamics, selected incomplete sets can recover essential\nfeatures, especially with the assistance of a projector.

While the ongoing\ninvestigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it\ncomplicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing\n(LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets,\nwhich results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a\ngraph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as\nnode features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to\nthe conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model\nexhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network\ntopology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single\ntrained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional\noptimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal\nthroughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders\nof magnitude.

By\nmerging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a\npromising direction.

Machine learning based methods for inverse folding typically\nuse recovery of the original sequence as the optimization objective.

Moreover, for many practical applications, it is often\ndesirable to have multiple, diverse sequences that fold into the target\nstructure since it allows for more candidate sequences for downstream\noptimizations. Here, we demonstrate that although recent inverse folding\nmethods show increased sequence recovery, their \"foldable diversity\"-i.e. their\nability to generate multiple non-similar sequences that fold into the\nstructures consistent with the target-does not increase. To address this, we\npresent RL-DIF, a categorical diffusion model for inverse folding that is\npre-trained on sequence recovery and tuned via reinforcement learning on\nstructural consistency.

            "summary": "Customizing diffusion models to generate identity-preserving images from\nuser-provided reference images is an intriguing new problem. The prevalent\napproaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to\nachieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use\ncases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free\ntechnique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for\npersonalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified\nflow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in\nrequiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point\nsolution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image\ndiscriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when\nanchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The\nderived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf\nimage discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human\nfaces, live subjects, and certain objects.

            "summary": "Recently, the strong latent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has been\napplied to high-quality Text-to-Image (T2I) generation (e.g., Stable\nDiffusion), by injecting the encoded target text prompt into the gradually\ndenoised diffusion image generator. Despite the success of DPM in practice, the\nmechanism behind it remains to be explored. To fill this blank, we begin by\nexamining the intermediate statuses during the gradual denoising generation\nprocess in DPM. The empirical observations indicate, the shape of image is\nreconstructed after the first few denoising steps, and then the image is filled\nwith details (e.g., texture). The phenomenon is because the low-frequency\nsignal (shape relevant) of the noisy image is not corrupted until the final\nstage in the forward process (initial stage of generation) of adding noise in\nDPM. Inspired by the observations, we proceed to explore the influence of each\ntoken in the text prompt during the two stages. After a series of experiments\nof T2I generations conditioned on a set of text prompts. We conclude that in\nthe earlier generation stage, the image is mostly decided by the special token\n[\\texttt{EOS}] in the text prompt, and the information in the text prompt is\nalready conveyed in this stage. After that, the diffusion model completes the\ndetails of generated images by information from themselves. Finally, we propose\nto apply this observation to accelerate the process of T2I generation by\nproperly removing text guidance, which finally accelerates the sampling up to\n25\\%+.",

            "summary": "We propose a novel approach to denoising diffusion magnetic resonance images\n(dMRI) using convolutional neural networks, that exploits the benefits of data\nacquired at multiple b-values to offset the need for many redundant\nobservations. Denoising is especially relevant in dMRI since noise can have a\ndeleterious impact on both quantification accuracy and image preprocessing. The\nmost successful methods proposed to date, like Marchenko-Pastur Principal\nComponent Analysis (MPPCA) denoising, are tailored to diffusion-weighting\nrepeated for many encoding directions. They exploit high redundancy of the\ndataset that oversamples the diffusion-encoding direction space, since many\ndirections have collinear components.\n  However, there are many dMRI techniques that do not entail a large number of\nencoding directions or repetitions, and are therefore less suited to this\napproach. For example, clinical dMRI exams may include as few as three encoding\ndirections, with low or negligible data redundancy across directions. Moreover,\npromising new dMRI approaches, like spherical b-tensor encoding (STE), benefit\nfrom high b-values while sensitizing the signal to diffusion along all\ndirections in just a single shot.\n  We introduce a convolutional neural network approach that we call\nmulti-b-value-based denoising (MBD). MBD exploits the similarity in\ndiffusion-weighted images (DWI) across different b-values but along the same\ndiffusion encoding direction. It allows denoising of diffusion images with high\nnoise variance while avoiding blurring, and using just a small number input\nimages.",

Training-time\ndefenses still exhibit a significant performance gap between natural accuracy\nand robust accuracy. In this paper, we investigate a new test-time adversarial\ndefense method via diffusion-based recovery along opposite adversarial paths\n(OAPs). We present a purifier that can be plugged into a pre-trained model to\nresist adversarial attacks. Different from prior arts, the key idea is\nexcessive denoising or purification by integrating the opposite adversarial\ndirection with reverse diffusion to push the input image further toward the\nopposite adversarial direction. For the first time, we also exemplify the\npitfall of conducting AutoAttack (Rand) for diffusion-based defense methods.\nThrough the lens of time complexity, we examine the trade-off between the\neffectiveness of adaptive attack and its computation complexity against our\ndefense. Experimental evaluation along with time cost analysis verifies the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",
