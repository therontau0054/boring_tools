            "summary": "Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching\napplications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of\nquantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding\nof magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,\nnuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress\nis the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible\nmagic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational\ninterpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this\nwork, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property\ntesting. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable\nmagic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state\nbecomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate\ngoverned by the stabilizer entropy $M(\\psi)$ and the number of available\ncopies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state\n$k$-design, with an approximation error $\\Theta(\\exp(-M(\\psi))$. Conversely, we\nestablish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state\nfrom the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.\nThese results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes\nthe transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby\noffering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a\nquantum resource.",

            "summary": "While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in\nthe last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed\nwhere groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in\nconventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so\nfar has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate\nthe nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and\nthe Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions.\nClarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to\nobtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both\ngenerally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler\nclass. Focusing on three-band $\\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two\ndimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the\npossible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We\nestablish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns\naccording to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant,\nhighlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by\nbuilding upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical\nconsequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice\nEuler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically\nconfirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss\npossible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to\nstudy the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap\ntopology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher\ndimensions.",

This study addresses such unvalidated\nassumptions intrinsic to the model and extends it within the framework of\nturbulence hierarchy theory. The theory suggests that under certain conditions,\nsmall-scale structures may transfer to larger scales through the rotational\nviscosity. To verify this, we conducted spectral analyses of freely decaying\ntwo-dimensional turbulence initialized with a vortex-concentrated distribution.\nThe results indicate that rotational viscosity exhibits interscale transfer\nbehavior, revealing a new mechanism by which order can propagate from small to\nlarge scales in Navier--Stokes turbulence.",

            "summary": "Collisions play an important role in turbulence and transport of fusion\nplasmas. For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain\nof interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can\nbecome overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to\nhigh computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have\nimplemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use\nin the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll\nframework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time\nintegrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time\nstep in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure\nconservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme\nto correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian\ndistribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further\ngeneralized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction\nroutine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and\nconservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more\ncomputationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has\nbeen utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables\n2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56\ntimes faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because\nthe BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is\nrequired by the LBD operator. Additionally, in this more collisional limit, we\ndemonstrate that the results of our simulations utilizing the implicit BGK\noperator agreed well with simulations utilizing the more computationally\nexpensive LBD operator.",

In certain quantum gravity theories and\nsemi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects)\nexhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger\nwaveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the\ndetector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features\nfollowing the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect\nsignatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black\nholes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform\ntemplates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In\nthis work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory\narising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose\nscalar ${\\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features\nis model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real\ninterferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio\nof echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is\nestimated subsequently.

Our main results apply to linear forward\nSDEs with additive noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify\nhow errors from the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under\ndifferent choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are\nderived using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward\nprocess, which enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along\nsampling. For exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an\nerror-correcting mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling\ntrajectory.

            "summary": "The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by\naligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant\nsolver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically\nshow that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to\nlearn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly\nmodel, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector\nfields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant\npath for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process.\nOur numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical\ndatasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input\npieces are non-overlapped.",
