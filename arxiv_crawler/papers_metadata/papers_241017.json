            "summary": "An important result in the theory of quantum control is the \"universality\" of\n$2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a\nsystem of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary\ngates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down\nin the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries\ncan be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts\nthe dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this\npaper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in\ngeneral be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with\nunitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries\nlead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the\nconnectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie\nalgebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically\nderiving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the\nframework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive\nsymmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two\ndifferent types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of\nthe superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical\nobservables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore\nthe universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its\nabsence.",

            "summary": "This paper presents a revolutionary approach to the characterization,\nforecast, and control of collective systems. Collective systems are an ensemble\nof conservatively interacting entities. The evolution of the entities are\ndetermined by symmetries of the entities. Collective systems take many\ndifferent forms. A plasma is a collective of charged particles, a fluid is a\ncollective of molecules, a elementary field is a collective of elementary\nparticles, and a cosmos is a collective of celestial bodies. Our new theory\nbuilds on the canonical transformation approach to dynamics. This approach\nrecognizes that the symmetry leads to the conservation of a real function, that\nis the infinitesimal generator of a Lie group. The finite generator of the\ncanonical transformation is derived from the infinitesimal generator by the\nsolution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This generating function is also\nknown as the action, the entropy, and the logarithmic likelihood. The new\ntheory generalizes this generating function to the generating functional of the\ncollective field. Finally, this paper derives the formula for the Mayer Cluster\nExpansion, or the S-matrix expansion of the generating functional. We call it\nthe Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). Practically, this is a\nlocalized Fourier Transformation, whose principal components give the\nsingularity spectrums, that is the solution to the Renormalization Group\nEquations. Limitations on the measurement of the system (that is the Born Rule\nand the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) lead to quantization of the\nstochastic probabilities of the collective field. How different collective\nsystems couple together to form systems-of-systems is formalized. The details\nof a practical implementation of the HST will be presented.",

Due to the high dimensionality of the\nproblem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately\npredict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are\npresent.

            "summary": "The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) is a conformally invariant random\ncollection of loops. In the non-simple regime $\\kappa'\\in (4,8)$, it describes\nthe scaling limit of the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolations. CLE\npercolations were introduced by Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2017). The\nCLE$_{\\kappa'}$ percolations describe the scaling limit of a natural variant of\nthe FK percolation called the fuzzy Potts model, which has an additional\npercolation parameter $r$. Based on CLE percolations and assuming that the\nconvergence of the FK percolation to CLE, K{\\\"o}hler-Schindler and Lehmkuehler\n(2022) derived all the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model except the bulk\none-arm exponent. In this paper, we exactly solve this exponent, which\nprescribes the dimension of the clusters in CLE$_{\\kappa'}$ percolations. As a\nspecial case, the bichromatic one-arm exponent for the critical 3-state Potts\nmodel should be $4/135$. To the best of our knowledge, this natural exponent\nwas not predicted in physics. Our derivation relies on the iterative\nconstruction of CLE percolations from the boundary conformal loop ensemble\n(BCLE), and the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and SLE curves. The\nsource of the exact solvability comes from the structure constants of boundary\nLiouville conformal field theory. A key technical step is to prove a conformal\nwelding result for the target-invariant radial SLE curves. As intermediate\nsteps in our derivation, we obtain several exact results for BCLE in both the\nsimple and non-simple regimes, which extend results of Ang-Sun-Yu-Zhuang (2024)\non the touching probability of non-simple CLE. This also provides an\nalternative derivation of the relation between the BCLE parameter $\\rho$ and\nthe additional percolation parameter $r$ in CLE percolations, which was\noriginally due to Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2021, 2022).",

This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via\ndiscrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect\non SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin\ndisorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is\nseen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that\nmaximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are\nimpervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state.\nFurther, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for\nphase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and\ndistorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin\ndisorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder,\nirrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE\ncan be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths\nat specific time steps.

Specifically, we design a\ndiffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically\napproximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more\nflexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the\nvalue encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a\ntext-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image,\nvalue principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through\nadaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces\nharmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong\nbaselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.",

We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via\nnumerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a\nconserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled\nreaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for\nspatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments\nin terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes\nthe geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns\nand the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how\noptimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative\ncontrol protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient\nflows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in\nphysical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in\nnon-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales.",
