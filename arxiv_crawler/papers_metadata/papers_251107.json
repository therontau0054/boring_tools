            "summary": "Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing\nsource of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.",

Numerical Weather\nPrediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for\nrapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models\nsuffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based\nmethods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate\nreconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully\nthree-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar\nreflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with\ndatadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields\nunder a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying\ndiffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to\nrepresent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective\ninitiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic\nmodule estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up\nto three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\\%\nof cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D\ndynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for\nskillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.",

In photonics, direct photon-photon\ninteractions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions\nare engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to\nrealize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain\nspatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential\nnon-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in\nboth qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by\nthe AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared\nentanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum\nindistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent\nsuperpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we\nuncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum\nteleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements.\nTechnically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical\nresource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they\ndemonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and\ntechniques in physics.",

Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025)\nrecently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary\nstrength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a\nfinite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that\nspan diverse mathematical and physical characteristics -- the Mohr--Coulomb, 3D\nHoek--Brown, and Mogi--Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical\nfracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture\nregimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from\nlarge pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and\ntoughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad\nrange of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and\nrobustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by\narbitrary strength surfaces.",

This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely\non an abstract routing model (e.g., three-$ \\mathrm{CX} $-unrolled SWAP\ninsertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported\nby physical devices.\n  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of\ndiverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard\n$\\mathrm{CX}$-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as\n$\\mathrm{\\sqrt{iSWAP}}$ and $\\mathrm{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gates offer superior circuit\nsynthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However,\nsystematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are\nlacking.\n  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing\nframework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical\nrepresentation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform\ndeep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit\ncanonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost\nfor more intelligent $ \\mathrm{SWAP} $ insertion during the routing stage. We\nalso formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the\ncanonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based\noptimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing\noverhead by 15\\%-35\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different\nISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for\nco-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.",

The MDM is able to sample tokens\nout-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,\nthere is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling\nthese models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling\nperformance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but\nthese are not tight for many natural classes of distributions.

While the connection to function approximation\nin principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show\nthat it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori\nknowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we\nalso demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of\nwell-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,\nits total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some\nnatural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss\nin performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.",
