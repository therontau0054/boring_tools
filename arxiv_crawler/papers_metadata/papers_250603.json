By the means of\nan optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time\nrequired for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or\nmore modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both\nefficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the\ngeodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the\nBose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap,\nfacilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive\neffective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling\nexperimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This\napproach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard\ngeodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled\nstates for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our\nfindings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in\nultracold atomic systems.",

The Dose Enhancement Ratio (DER) was studied\nin water and breast tissue with spherical shapes and in agreement with\npreviously published results. To further analyse the physical interactions of\nthe particles around the AuNP, a Phase Space File (PSF) in a volume around the\nAuNPs was created. This showed that larger AuNPs lead to increased doses, as\nexpected, yielding DER values exceeding 100 times. Finally, results reveal that\nin the volume surrounding the AuNP, 80% of emitted electrons originate from\nphotoelectric absorption, leading to Auger electron emission cascades which\nwere analysed in detail. It was also possible to establish a direct relation\nbetween number of secondaries and the particle volumes. The Local Effect Model\n(LEM) was used to determine survival curves in AuNPs of different sizes at\ndifferent gold concentrations. The last part of this work consisted in\nanalysing a distribution of AuNPs within a flattened cell typical of clonogenic\nassays where a log-normal distribution of dose was observed.

The mental state of preference is modeled as a coherent\nsuperposition in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, with time evolution governed\nby a stimulus-dependent Hamiltonian H(t), which reflects the sensory or\nmotivational impact of external input. The observed score (e.g., 0 to 10)\ncorresponds to the squared amplitude projected onto the \"like\" basis without\ncollapsing the underlying state. For group-level analysis, we introduce a novel\nmetric called \"like-polarization\", analogous to spin polarization, which\nquantifies the collective orientation of preferences. This model provides a\nphysically motivated alternative to classical evaluation theories, offering\ninsights into the reversibility, context-dependence, and temporal dynamics of\nhuman judgment.

To address this, we propose a stage-aware\nprompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a\nsequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the\nsemantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while\nensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a\nlarge language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify\ncontradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original\nintent while resolving contextual conflicts.
