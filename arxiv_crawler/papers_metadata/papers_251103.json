            "summary": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer\nscreening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack\nLDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer\ndetection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening\nTrial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of\n26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)\nradiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar\nmicrostructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly\nimprove early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning\nsegmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of\neuthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular\nboundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A\nU-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,\nor a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model\nachieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51\npercent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus\n92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent\nsensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially\nimproves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation\nradiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose\nalternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is\nunavailable.",

Following a sudden quench of\nthe system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins\nexhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider\ntwo quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength\nand the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a\nthreshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining\nvalid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and\nsystem sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional\nclassical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this\ntransition during dynamics.",

While various numerical and experimental\nmethods exist, they typically require deep physical insights and incur high\ncomputational costs. Machine learning offers an alternative by learning\npredictive patterns directly from data, avoiding explicit physical modeling.\nHowever, purely data-driven approaches often lack interpretability, physical\nconsistency, and generalizability in sparse data regimes. To this end, we\npropose TrajectoryFlowNet, a Lagrangian-Eulerian physics-informed neural\nnetwork architecture, for fluid flow velocimetry and imaging via learning to\npredict spatiotemporal flow fields and long-range particle trajectories. The\nsalient features of our model include its ability to handle complex flow\npatterns with irregular boundaries, predict the full-field flows, image the\nlong-range flow trajectory of any arbitrary particle, and ensure physical\nconsistency in predictions based only on very scarce measurement of flow\ntrajectories. We validate TrajectoryFlowNet via both numerical examples (e.g.,\nlid-driven cavity flow and complex cylinder flow) and experimental test cases\n(e.g., aortic and ventricle blood flows) across diverse flow scenarios.

It is applied to several classes of\n$\\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all\nindependent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of\nthe CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$,\nscalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a\nstandard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state\nparameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\\Gamma$ the reheating\ntemperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some\npivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model\nindependent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the\nupper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each\nclass of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral\nindex $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB\ndata. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact\non our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying\nthose tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB\nobservables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an\nexample, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One\nobtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM\nproduction. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the\nreheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints\non the DM production will follow.",

The analysis\nreveals that decoherence inevitably transforms an initially pure Bell state\ninto a mixed state and predicts a critical storage efficiency threshold of\n89.7%. Above this threshold, the retrieved photon violates the Clauser-Horne\ninequality, confirming the preservation of nonlocal quantum correlations,\nwhereas below it, nonlocality is lost.

            "summary": "Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in\napplications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has\nalso been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of\nrate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While\nempirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better\ngeneration quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical\nworks have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably,\nconvergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are\nstill missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and\nconvergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate\nmatrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the\nforward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address\nthe challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a\nsingleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the\nfirst convergence guarantees for both the $\\tau$-leaping and uniformization\nsamplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their\ncounterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable\nassumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our\nanalysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to\nabsorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding\nforward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score\nfunctions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization\nthat removes the need of early-stopping.",

            "authors": "Yuchen Jiao, Yuchen Zhou, Gen Li",
            "summary": "Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical success in\ngenerating high-quality samples from target data distributions. Among them, the\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used\nsamplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its\nempirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its\nconvergence properties -- remains limited.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler\nand establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional\nassumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition\nparameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical\ndistributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler\nwith accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of\n$$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d\\min\\{d,L^2\\}}{T^2}\\right)~\\text{in\nKullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the\nnumber of iterations, and $\\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$.\nThis result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L <\n\\sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence\nanalysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions. Moreover, it\nreveals that DDPM and DDIM share the same dependence on $d$, raising an\ninteresting question of why DDIM often appears empirically faster.",
