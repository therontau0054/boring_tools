Using an effective description of\nnew physics in terms of four-fermion operators involving a charm quark, we\nconstrain the Wilson coefficients of the effective interaction from two and\nthree-body charmed meson decays. In our fit, we include charmed meson decays\nnot only to pseudoscalar final states but also to vector final states and\ninclude decays to the $\\eta$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ final states. We also consider\nconstraints from charmed baryon decays. We then study the effect of new physics\nin neutrino scattering processes, involving charm production at SND@LHC, for\nvarious benchmark new physics couplings obtained from the low energy fits.\nFinally, we also study the effects of lepton universality violation (LUV)\nassuming that the new physics coupling is not lepton universal.",

The physics of\nlaser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly\nthe trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to\nimage-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture\ncapable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band\nRF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100\nMeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a\ndistributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF\npulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by\nthe illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses\nsynchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV\npulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes\nthe RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band\ncontinuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10\n$\\mu$A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a\ncompact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton\nscattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of \"clinical\"\nfootprint.

Expanding on\nWitten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer\nhomology groups $HF_{\\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are\nexpected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to\nthe original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the\nsolutions of the $\\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton\nsolutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the\nfive-dimensional cylinder $\\mathbb{R}_s \\times W^4$. The relation to knot\ninvariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3\n\\times \\mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \\subset X^3 \\times \\{0\\}$ embedded in\nits three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold\nrequire the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological\ninvariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various\ndimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a\ncomprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to\nwell-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the\n$\\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and\ntwisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on\nthe elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole\nboundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of\nHaydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an\nequality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\\bullet_{\\pi/2}([S^3\n\\times \\mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\\bullet(K)$.",

We redevelop the\nVAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow,\nembedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space\ndeveloped by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which\nthe latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our\nchoosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the\ntraditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of\nprior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing\nterm. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative,\nand can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach,\nallowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can\nbe formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric\nsingularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps\nensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a\ncanonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods\nfocus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations\nfor the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest,\nour methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes\nbetter. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed\narchitecture, frequently reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) error between 15%\nto 35% on select datasets.

To satisfy all\nthese conditions, we aim to demonstrate that the spatial evolution law\ninevitably encapsulates the curvature of the bulk, including quantum effects.\nFor a computational model, we compactify the hyperplanes to tori, reducing the\ndegrees of freedom to a finite number; taking these tori to infinite size then\nrestores Poincar\\'e symmetry.

However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in\nthis two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in\nvisual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially\nlarger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable\ngeneration performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for\nsub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information\nloss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive\ncomputation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent\ndifficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address\nthis, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation\nmodels when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision\nfoundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the\nreconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster\nconvergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces.\nTo exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with\nimproved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT.

            "summary": "Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data\ngeneration. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative\nmodelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score\nmatching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting\nthe previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for\nsingle-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position,\nvelocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data\ngeneration at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\nand two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude.\nEmpirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set\nCIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet\ninception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the\nstate-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.",
