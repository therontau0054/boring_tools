We also develop a physical picture of the\npolariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force\nof the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of\nspatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al.,\nPhys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high\nresolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and\ntransmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory\nmatches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and\nnear-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes\ninvested in collective modes of the plasma.",

            "summary": "Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate\nthe features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's\ntwo-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models\nbased on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the\nscale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the\ninverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We\nshow that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously\nintroduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction,\nformally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived\nfrom the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical\nhydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model\nbased on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic\nfluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing\nto the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic\nfluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the\nsize of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical\nanalysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and\nincorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our\nresults and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of\nthe cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal\nfluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow\nidentified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence\nof molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the\nhydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy\nviscosity.",

The automated labeling of\nthese confinement states is crucial to enable large-scale analyses or for\nreal-time control applications. While this task becomes difficult to automate\nnear state transitions or in marginal scenarios, much success has been achieved\nwith data-driven models. However, these methods generally provide predictions\nas point estimates, and cannot adequately deal with missing and/or broken input\nsignals. To enable wide-range applicability, we develop methods for confinement\nstate classification with uncertainty quantification and model robustness. We\nfocus on off-line analysis for TCV discharges, distinguishing L-mode, H-mode,\nand an in-between dithering phase (D). We propose ensembling data-driven\nmethods on two axes: model formulations and feature sets. The former considers\na dynamic formulation based on a recurrent Fourier Neural Operator-architecture\nand a static formulation based on gradient-boosted decision trees. These models\nare trained using multiple feature groupings categorized by diagnostic system\nor physical quantity. A dataset of 302 TCV discharges is fully labeled, and\nwill be publicly released. We evaluate our method quantitatively using Cohen's\nkappa coefficient for predictive performance and the Expected Calibration Error\nfor the uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we discuss performance using a\nvariety of common and alternative scenarios, the performance of individual\ncomponents, out-of-distribution performance, cases of broken or missing\nsignals, and evaluate conditionally-averaged behavior around different state\ntransitions. Overall, the proposed method can distinguish L, D and H-mode with\nhigh performance, can cope with missing or broken signals, and provides\nmeaningful uncertainty estimates.",

Because each step in the iterative solution requires an\nexpensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest\nin approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without\nmodifying the underlying model. However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that\ntracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional\nODE solvers. In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver\nfor the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S). S4S directly optimizes\na solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a\nstrong teacher solver. We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs,\nincluding pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and\nunconditional sampling. In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample\nquality relative to traditional ODE solvers. Moreover, our method is\nlightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any\ndiscretization schedule or architecture to improve performance. Building on top\nof this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the\ndiscretization schedule. By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers,\nwith 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO,\nrepresenting a $1.5\\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.",

            "summary": "Machine learning algorithms are used in diverse domains, many of which face\nsignificant challenges due to data imbalance. Studies have explored various\napproaches to address the issue, like data preprocessing, cost-sensitive\nlearning, and ensemble methods. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) showed\nimmense potential as a data preprocessing technique that generates good quality\nsynthetic data. This study employs a systematic mapping methodology to analyze\n3041 papers on GAN-based sampling techniques for imbalanced data sourced from\nfour digital libraries. A filtering process identified 100 key studies spanning\ndomains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Through comprehensive\nquantitative analysis, this research introduces three categorization mappings\nas application domains, GAN techniques, and GAN variants used to handle the\nimbalanced nature of the data. GAN-based over-sampling emerges as an effective\npreprocessing method. Advanced architectures and tailored frameworks helped\nGANs to improve further in the case of data imbalance. GAN variants like\nvanilla GAN, CTGAN, and CGAN show great adaptability in structured imbalanced\ndata cases. Interest in GANs for imbalanced data has grown tremendously,\ntouching a peak in recent years, with journals and conferences playing crucial\nroles in transmitting foundational theories and practical applications. While\nwith these advances, none of the reviewed studies explicitly explore hybridized\nGAN frameworks with diffusion models or reinforcement learning techniques. This\ngap leads to a future research idea develop innovative approaches for\neffectively handling data imbalance.",
