Semidefinite programming relaxations have been\nfruitful in designing theoretical approximation algorithms for QMC, but are\ncomputationally expensive for systems beyond tens of qubits. We give a second\norder cone relaxation for QMC, which optimizes over the set of mutually\nconsistent three-qubit reduced density matrices. In combination with Pauli\nlevel-$1$ of the quantum Lasserre hierarchy, the relaxation achieves an\napproximation ratio of $0.526$ to the ground state energy. Our relaxation is\nsolvable on systems with hundreds of qubits and paves the way to\ncomputationally efficient lower and upper bounds on the ground state energy of\nlarge-scale quantum spin systems.",

As a result, classification methods usually perform\npoorly with these small datasets, leading to weak predictive performance.\nIncreasing the training set with additional synthetic data, similar to data\naugmentation in images, is commonly believed to improve downstream\nclassification performance. However, current tabular generative methods that\nlearn either the joint distribution $ p(\\mathbf{x}, y) $ or the\nclass-conditional distribution $ p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y) $ often overfit on small\ndatasets, resulting in poor-quality synthetic data, usually worsening\nclassification performance compared to using real data alone. To solve these\nchallenges, we introduce TabEBM, a novel class-conditional generative method\nusing Energy-Based Models (EBMs). Unlike existing methods that use a shared\nmodel to approximate all class-conditional densities, our key innovation is to\ncreate distinct EBM generative models for each class, each modelling its\nclass-specific data distribution individually. This approach creates robust\nenergy landscapes, even in ambiguous class distributions. Our experiments show\nthat TabEBM generates synthetic data with higher quality and better statistical\nfidelity than existing methods. When used for data augmentation, our synthetic\ndata consistently improves the classification performance across diverse\ndatasets of various sizes, especially small ones.
