            "summary": "Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its\nstatistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a\nrank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when\nit is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and\nan efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant\nestimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The\nreason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank\ndimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the\nlack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make\nprogress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal\nis a factored matrix $XX^\\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte\nCarlo simulations suggest the existence of a \\emph{denoising-factorisation\ntransition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant\nestimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same\nnature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and\nbetter denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is\nonly beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself,\nbecomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine\nmean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access\nthe minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our\nalternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of\n[3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we\nconjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality\nwhen it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole\nphase diagram when considering finite size effects.",

When paired with a contrastive loss\nfunction, this naturally leads to representations that capture the physics in\nthe initial stages of the simulation.

While the exchange of energy and linear\nmomentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a\ncornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular\nmomentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular\nmomentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant\nmagnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity,\nultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process\nof phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach\nany magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena\nin solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of\nangular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical\nnonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp\nscattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold\nrotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify\nnonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel,\nconfirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications\nfor angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses\nthe natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular\nmomentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics,\nrepresenting a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and\nchiral quasi-particles.",

In this work, we show that\nnon-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the\nnon-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We\ndemonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin\neffect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for\nisolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise.\nOur findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or\noscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of\nnoise.

In this work, we study in detail the\neffect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on\ndeep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$\nsymmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and\nanalyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge\nfluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not\nit can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing\nuniversal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the\nlimiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy\nprinciples rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This\nlimiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and\nmeasurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona\nfide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary\napproaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations\nin either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical\ncalculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge\nfluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but\nnot both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the\nmost general case.

            "summary": "Modeling the evolution of physical systems is critical to many applications\nin science and engineering. As the evolution of these systems is governed by\npartial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational\nsimulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these\nsimulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed\nfor large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural\nnetwork surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more\ncomputationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high\nrollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with\ntraining data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout\nerror by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of\nthe model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers'\nin the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with\nphysical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and\nsimulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially\nin legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement\nLearning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which\ncombines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with\nor without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly. In\naddition to reducing in-distribution rollout error by 47%-78%, HyPER learns an\nintelligent policy that is adaptable to changing physical conditions and\nresistant to noise corruption.

The current\nstate-of-the-art methods follow a two-step process: first estimating the score\nfunction (the gradient of a smoothed log-distribution) and then applying a\ngradient-based sampling algorithm. The resulting distribution's correctness can\nbe impacted by several factors: the generalization error due to a finite number\nof initial samples, the error in score matching, and the diffusion error\nintroduced by the sampling algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the sampling\nprocess in a simple yet representative setting-sampling from Gaussian\ndistributions using a Langevin diffusion sampler. We provide a sharp analysis\nof the Wasserstein sampling error that arises from the multiple sources of\nerror throughout the pipeline.

            "summary": "Time-series analysis is critical for a wide range of fields such as\nhealthcare, finance, transportation, and energy, among many others. The\npractical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside\ncontextual information in the form of natural language to support informed\ndecisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to\nperform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In\nthis work, we address this gap by introducing \\textit{Chat-TS}, a large\nlanguage model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time\nseries and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates\ntime-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over\nboth modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities,\nenabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support\nlearning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the\n\\textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with\nrelevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \\textit{TS\nInstruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice\nquestions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \\textit{TS Instruct\nQuantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA\ntasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation. We\ndesigned a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of\nLLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that\nChat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks by\nmaintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series\nreasoning. ~\\footnote{To ensure replicability and facilitate future research,\nall models, datasets, and code will be available at [\\texttt{Github-URL}].}",
