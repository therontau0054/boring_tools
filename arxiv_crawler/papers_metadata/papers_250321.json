The first is the recent evidence from the DESI\nproject and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$\nis evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$<-1$ to a\npresent-day value~$>-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension,\ndescribing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to\nthat expected in the~$\\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically\nnatural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter\nconsists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark\nenergy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark\nmatter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits\na phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in\na slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall\ngrowth of density perturbations.",

Despite its importance, the application of DFT is\nfrequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to\nconstruct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current\nresearch has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and\nsolid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural\nnetworks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when\napplied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of\nground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger\ntraining set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable\nmodel for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce\na loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction\nAlignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the\npredicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting\ndifferences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing\nmodels to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies\nthan previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates\nself-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a\nreduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF\ncalculation speed-up by a factor of 18%.

We address this gap by\ninvestigating heat transfer and mixing in the iCVD reactor using in-situ gas\ncomposition sensing. Our work allows practitioners of iCVD to estimate the\ndegree of mixing and temperature profile in the vapor phase based on reactor\ndimensions and process variables such as chamber pressure. We begin by using\ndimensional analysis to simplify the parameter space governing heat transfer\nand mixing, identifying key dimensionless groups that capture the dominant\nphysics. We find that the degree of mixing in the reactor is primarily\ndetermined by the Peclet number (Pe), and heat transfer is primarily determined\nby the Knudsen number (Kn). Multiphysics simulations of the iCVD reactor\nprovide visualizations of non-ideal mixing and allow us to identify the\ncritical Pe above which the well-mixed assumption may begin to break down. To\nverify that the well-mixed assumption applies to iCVD at low Pe, we measured\nthe residence time distribution (RTD) for argon and isopropanol flowing at 1\nsccm, finding a close match to the well-mixed model. We used a Pirani pressure\ngauge for composition sensing to measure the RTD. We demonstrate the Pirani\ngauge to be a precise gas composition sensor, which is more modular and less\nexpensive than methods like in-situ infrared spectroscopy and mass\nspectrometry. We then address heat transfer by measuring thermal diffusion from\nthe filament at a range of pressures in argon and isopropanol. We quantified\nthe effects of non-ideal heat transfer at low pressures and identified a\ncritical Kn, above which heat transfer is independent of pressure. Measurement\nof thermally driven pressure changes in batch mode enables us to define and\nmodel an \"effective temperature\" for the reactor, matching the thermal\ndiffusion model.",

The mass is assumed to experience a linear\ndamping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental\nin theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with\nparity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two\nmetastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include\nnonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis\ncircuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated\nconformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work\nwe consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented\nby a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential\nhas two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability\nparameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of\nthe equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In\nthe absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of\nanharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types.\nHowever, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical\nsolutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described\nby Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into\nconsideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases\nor vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply\nvarying the deformability parameter.

However, inference-time scaling has received less\nattention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation\nattempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of \"golden noises\" that\ncan enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that\nguiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise\ncandidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the\ncurrent step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing\nthe anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term\nvalue. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible\nadjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step\ndenoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant\nlong-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a\nplug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial\nnoises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency\nand visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert\ninitial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value,\nleveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover,\nto preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution\nthat up-weights promising noises.
