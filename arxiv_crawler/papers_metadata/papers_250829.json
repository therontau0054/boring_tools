One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems\nis to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the\nMatsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible\nwith the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we\nfurnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their\ndistinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are\ndescribed by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize\nthe zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH\nsystems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic\nresponse of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH\nDirac model subject to various physical descriptions.",

            "summary": "Proton decay experiments typically constrain baryon number violation to the\nscale of grand unified theories. From a phenomenological point of view, this\nmakes direct probing of the associated new resonances, such as the X and Y\nbosons, out of reach for even the most optimistic future experiments. It has,\nhowever, been known that certain specific patterns of baryon and lepton number\nviolation can suppress proton decay by multiple powers of the masses of the\nheavy resonances involved, opening the possibility that the observed limits on\nthe proton lifetime are consistent with baryon number violating physics at\nenergy scales much lower than that of grand unification. We construct an\nexplicit example of such a model which violates baryon number by one unit,\n$\\Delta \\text{B} = -1$, and lepton number by three units, $\\Delta \\text{L} =\n-3$, and show that despite stringent limits on the predicted $p \\rightarrow\ne^{+}/\\mu^{+} \\overline{\\nu}\\overline{\\nu}$ mode from the Super-Kamiokande\nexperiment, the masses of the newly introduced elementary particles can be\n$\\mathcal{O}$(TeV). We identify interesting unique signatures of baryon number\nviolation of this model that can be probed both with currently available LHC\ndata and with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC.

To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct\nstrictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such\nthat their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with\ncoordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then\nintroduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these\nsatisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably,\ntree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity\nfor z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of\ntree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of\nout-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation\nfunctions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional\ndual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the\nexistence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly\nvelocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called\n$\\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in\nnon-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates,\ndiscuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement\ngrowth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a\nphysically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.",

In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard\nlinear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized\nKaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized\nKaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies.",

This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

We show\nadditional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields.\nHowever, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and\npolarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark\nsector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the\nevolution of the matter density.
