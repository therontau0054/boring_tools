Most, if not all, of the current\nexperimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana\nzero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic\nproperty of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal\nencoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a\ncrucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in\nthe laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated\nlocalized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength\nenhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the\nqubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to\nthe realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant\nquantum computation.",

However, the manual modeling of\nfaulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models\nthat are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this\nchallenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that\nintegrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process\nmining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected\nfrom low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These\nanomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the\ndiscovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By\nincorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach\nsupports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root\ncause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using\nthe Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart\nmanufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,\nsimulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs.

We find\nadditional scaling solutions, some of which are parametric extensions of the\nunbiased ones while others are new scaling branches which do not exist in the\nunbiased case.

Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating\nphysics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral\nmodel, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative\neffects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over\ntopologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest\nframeworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how\nit applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular,\nwe emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a\nsubsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert\nspace, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be\nused as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a\nnontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating\nobservers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that\nimplementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent\ngeneralization of holography.",

While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in\nimage and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to\nthe complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in\nartifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a\nconditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural\nsinging voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage\nand often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized\naudio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated\nwith two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch\narchitecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference\nto guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware\nsynthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel\nlow-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch\ncontours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during\ntraining, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,\naddressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals.

However, the\ndesign choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,\nare numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce\noptimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this\npaper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter\nconfigurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:\nHindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.\n  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in\ncapturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short\nmelodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range\ndependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze\ncomputational resource requirements across different adapter scales,\ndemonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal\nbalance between expressivity and quality.
