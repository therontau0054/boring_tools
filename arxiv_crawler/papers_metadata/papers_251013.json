            "summary": "Quantum weight reduction is the task of transforming a quantum code with\nlarge check weight into one with small check weight. Low-weight codes are\nessential for implementing quantum error correction on physical hardware, since\nhigh-weight measurements cannot be executed reliably. Weight reduction also\nserves as a critical theoretical tool, which may be relevant to the quantum PCP\nconjecture.\n  We introduce a new procedure for quantum weight reduction that combines\ngeometric insights with coning techniques, which simplifies Hastings' previous\napproach while achieving better parameters. Given an arbitrary $[[n,k,d]]$\nquantum code with weight $w$, our method produces a code with parameters $[[O(n\nw^2 \\log w), k, \\Omega(d w)]]$ with check weight $5$ and qubit weight $6$.\n  When applied to random dense CSS codes, our procedure yields explicit quantum\ncodes that surpass the square-root distance barrier, achieving parameters $[[n,\n\\tilde O(n^{1/3}), \\tilde \\Omega(n^{2/3})]]$. Furthermore, these codes admit a\nthree-dimensional embedding that saturates the Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal (BPT)\nbound.\n  As a further application, our weight reduction technique improves\nfault-tolerant logical operator measurements by reducing the number of ancilla\nqubits.",

By\nderiving the competing scaling relations for counting noise ($\\propto h^{-1}$)\nand binning distortion ($\\propto h^{2}$), we establish an optimal bin width\nthat balances statistical precision and structural resolution. Application to\nsynthetic data from the Debye scattering function of a Gaussian polymer chain\ndemonstrates that the FD criterion quantitatively determines the most efficient\nbinning, faithfully reproducing the curvature of $I(Q)$ while minimizing random\nerror. The optimal width follows the expected scaling $h_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\propto\nN_{\\mathrm{total}}^{-1/3}$, delineating the transition between noise- and\nresolution-limited regimes.

Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a\nvirtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were\ncaptured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor.

The ground\nstate dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the\nultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing.

Variational\nsymmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie\nsymmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie\npoint divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the\n2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries,\nthus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method.\nMoreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry\ncalculations for a wide class of particle physics models.

While\nrecent advancements in the use of neural networks for system monitoring have\nshown promising results, such methods often focus on component-level analysis,\nlack generalizability, and physical interpretability. In this study, we propose\na novel hybrid framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)\nwith deep operator networks (DeepONet) to enable accurate and computationally\nefficient parameter identification in mean-value diesel engine models. Our\nmethod leverages physics-based system knowledge in combination with data-driven\ntraining of neural networks to enhance model applicability. Incorporating\noffline-trained DeepONets to predict actuator dynamics significantly lowers the\nonline computation cost when compared to the existing PINN framework. To\naddress the re-training burden typical of PINNs under varying input conditions,\nwe propose two transfer learning (TL) strategies: (i) a multi-stage TL scheme\noffering better runtime efficiency than full online training of the PINN model\nand (ii) a few-shot TL scheme that freezes a shared multi-head network body and\ncomputes physics-based derivatives required for model training outside the\ntraining loop. The second strategy offers a computationally inexpensive and\nphysics-based approach for predicting engine dynamics and parameter\nidentification, offering computational efficiency over the existing PINN\nframework.
