To this\npurpose, we consider explicit mediators that contribute to these processes in\nthe $s$- and $t$-channels, comparing their effects in Drell-Yan distributions\nwith the ones obtained by matching onto the corresponding EFT. We determine the\nconditions for the EFT results to accurately describe these scenarios. In\nparticular, we explore the impact of including dimension-eight $(d=8)$\noperators in the faster convergence of the EFT series, at the analytical and\nnumerical level, considering contributions to the cross section up to the\nsquare of $d=8$ EFT operator insertions. Moreover, we discuss the possible\nimplications of clipping LHC data and illustrate results for a specific\nNew-Physics scenario motivated by low-energy flavor data.",

Fundamentally, two systems can\nexchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning\nevanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity,\nthe former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance,\nchemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent\nphase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom,\nanalogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller\nimpact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable\nevanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton\ncondensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the\npolariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an\nevanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic\ncondensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference\npatterns.
