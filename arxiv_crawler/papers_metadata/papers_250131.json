Here we realize a digital quantum\nsimulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on\nreconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on\nKitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are\nencoded using long-range entangled states.

We further\nexplore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and\ndirectly probing fermion exchange statistics.

However, their experimental estimation is challenging, as it\ninvolves preparing and measuring quantum states in multiple bases - a\nresource-intensive process susceptible to producing non-physical RDMs due to\nshot noise from limited measurements. To address this, we propose a method to\nmitigate shot noise by re-enforcing certain physicality constraints on RDMs.\nWhile verifying RDM compatibility with a global state is QMA-complete, we relax\nthis condition by enforcing compatibility constraints up to a certain level\nusing a polynomial-size semidefinite program to reconstruct overlapping RDMs\nfrom simulated experimental data. Our approach yields, on average, tighter\nbounds for the same number of measurements compared to tomography without\ncompatibility constraints.

For example,\nunlike traditional softmax attention heads that use a static output-value (OV)\nmatrix to delete or copy inputs that the heads attend to, Cog Attention\nnaturally learns to use the sign of dynamic query-key (QK) inner products to\nrepresent these operations. This enables Cog Attention to perform multiple\noperations simultaneously within a single head. Meanwhile, Cog Attention's OV\nmatrix can focus more on refinement or modification. (2) Cog Attention enhances\nthe model's robustness against representational collapse by preventing the\n``over-squashing'' of earlier tokens into later positions. We develop\nTransformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including\ndecoder-only models at various scales for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion\nmodels for image generation.
