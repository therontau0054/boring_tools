            "summary": "In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become\nphysical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase\nspace formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter\nlocalizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts\nthat these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any\nquantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum\ncorner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and\nquantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum\nrepresentations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do\nso for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined.\nWe then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of\n$4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement\nentropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a\nsemiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the\nsemiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum\ninformational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general\nstates and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement\nentropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.",

In the realm\nof condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials\nbased on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this\nsystem, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,\nif an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues\nof quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in\nthe region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the\nlocation of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear\neffects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the\nFermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the\n\\textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole\nas a {\\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both\nthe correct temperature {\\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes.\nThese results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of\nblack hole physics in a laboratory setting.",

The\nK{\\alpha}{\\alpha} emissions are due to two-electron one-photon transitions.\nInterestingly, the K{\\alpha}{\\alpha} lines in projectile ions are only seen\nwith 1.8 MeV energy. In contrast, the K{\\alpha}{\\alpha} lines in the target\nions are also well observed with 2.1 MeV energy. Surprisingly, the Al K x-ray\nline intensities are strongly suppressed, and the K{\\alpha}{\\alpha} line\nintensities are unexpectedly enhanced. The underlying physical process is found\nto be the photoionization caused by intense bremsstrahlung radiation. This\nphotoionization process converts most of the singly ionized K shell states\n(\\approx 82\\% at 2.1 MeV) to doubly ionized K shell states. This phenomenon is\nsilently present on many occasions.

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework\nfor near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds have recently been reported\nfor specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response\nequality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into\nspatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that\nresponse properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and\ndwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem and recently developed non-equilibrium linear\nresponse relations. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them\nto time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of\nthe tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical\nsignificance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response\nproperties from sampling unperturbed trajectories, offering significant\nadvantages over traditional finite-difference approaches for estimating\nresponse properties of complex networks and biological systems far from\nequilibrium.",

In particular, thanks to the\nformal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge\nmodes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the\nbulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs\nwith boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be\nassociated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in\norder to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the\nprediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall\nsystems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a\nphysical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum\nField Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have\nnon-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining\nsymmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the\nboundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which\nalso appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a\npossible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton\nquasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the\nalgebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never\nproved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter,\nelasticity and (massive) gravity models.
