In this paper, we present a method to\nconjugate single-stranded DNA to the enzyme urease while maintaining enzymatic\nactivity. We show evidence of successful conjugation and quantify the variables\nthat affect the conjugation yield. We also show that the enzymatic activity is\nunchanged after conjugation compared to the enzyme in its native state.\nFinally, we demonstrate the tethering of urease to nanostructures made using\nDNA origami with high site-specificity. Decorating nanostructures with\nenzymatically-active urease may prove to be useful in studying, or even\nutilizing, the functionality of urease in disciplines ranging from\nbiotechnology to soft-matter physics. The techniques we present in this paper\nwill enable researchers across these fields to modify enzymes without\ndisrupting their functionality, thus allowing for more insightful studies into\ntheir behavior and utility.",

A precise multi-dimensional\ndescription of the hadron structure has, in fact, the potential to deepen our\nunderstanding of the strong interactions and to provide a much more precise\nframework for measuring both Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model\nobservables. This ambitious task poses its basis on the recent experience with\nthe successful installation and operation of the SMOG2 unpolarized gas target\nin front of the LHCb spectrometer. Besides allowing for interesting physics\nstudies ranging from astrophysics to heavy-ion physics, SMOG2 provides an ideal\nbenchmark for studying beam-target dynamics at the LHC and demonstrates the\nfeasibility of simultaneous operation with beam-beam collisions. With the\ninstallation of the proposed polarized target system, LHCb will become the\nfirst experiment to simultaneously collect data from unpolarized beam-beam\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV and polarized and unpolarized beam-target\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim$100 GeV. LHCspin has the potential to open new\nfrontiers in physics by exploiting the capabilities of the world's most\npowerful collider and one of the most advanced spectrometers.
