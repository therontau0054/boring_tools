            "summary": "Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for\nconstructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of\nactual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among\nall qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive\nas it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. We\npropose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels,\nwhere their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with\nhigher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels,\nwe first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose\nthe Lindbladian generator of an actual noise channel into components based on\ninterqubit correlation degree. We generate a $k$-th order approximate noise\nchannel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components\nwith correlations up to the $k$-th degree. We require that the approximate\nnoise channels must be accurate and also ``honest\", i.e., the actual errors are\nnot underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply\nour method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a\n[[2,0,2]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for\nrealistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits\ncoupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit\ncorrelation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our\napproach provides a systematic characterization of multi-qubit noise\ncorrelations, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable\napproximations to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or\nexperimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are\nefficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.",

In this\npaper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog\nreservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the\ninformation processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the\ndegradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and\ndemonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that\ncan be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We\nborrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model\nof computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential\nreduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by\nrelating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a\nfamily of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to\nexpress our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any\nphysical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used\nto perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large\nlatent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.",

For the latter,\nparity-time-reflection ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in\nunderstanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these\nsystems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze\nmodels governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and\nrelated Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational\nnonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform\nfor non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence\nof exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties\nare tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these\nsymmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the\nconnection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear\nsystem becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries\nare related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the\nlinearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global\nchanges in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus\noffer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems.\nTri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for\nhigher-dimensional systems.",

In the Bayesian inference setting,\ntraditional parameter estimation methods rely on repeated simulations of\npotentially expensive forward models to determine the posterior distribution of\nthe parameter values, which may result in computationally intractable\nworkflows. Furthermore, methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nnecessitate rerunning the entire algorithm for each new data observation,\nfurther increasing the computational burden. Hence, we propose a novel method\nfor efficiently obtaining posterior distributions of parameter estimates for\nhigh-fidelity models given data observations of interest. The method first\nconstructs a low-fidelity, conditional generative model capable of amortized\nBayesian inference and hence rapid posterior density approximation over a\nwide-range of data observations. When higher accuracy is needed for a specific\ndata observation, the method employs adaptive refinement of the density\napproximation. It uses outputs from the low-fidelity generative model to refine\nthe parameter sampling space, ensuring efficient use of the computationally\nexpensive high-fidelity solver. Subsequently, a high-fidelity, unconditional\ngenerative model is trained to achieve greater accuracy in the target posterior\ndistribution. Both low- and high- fidelity generative models enable efficient\nsampling from the target posterior and do not require repeated simulation of\nthe high-fidelity forward model.
