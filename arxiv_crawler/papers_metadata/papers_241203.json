The growth rate decreases with increasing\nshear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\\'enic.\nWe also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth\nrate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio,\nthe opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that\neven a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling\nbehaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear\nflow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the\nelectron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection\nevents in the near-Sun Alfv\\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker\nSolar Probe.",

            "summary": "Generative models that satisfy hard constraints are crucial in many\nscientific and engineering applications where physical laws or system\nrequirements must be strictly respected. However, many existing constrained\ngenerative models, especially those developed for computer vision, rely heavily\non gradient information, often sparse or computationally expensive in fields\nlike partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework for adapting pre-trained, unconstrained flow-matching models to\nsatisfy constraints exactly in a zero-shot manner without requiring expensive\ngradient computations or fine-tuning. Our framework, ECI sampling, alternates\nbetween extrapolation (E), correction (C), and interpolation (I) stages during\neach iterative sampling step of flow matching sampling to ensure accurate\nintegration of constraint information while preserving the validity of the\ngeneration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various PDE\nsystems, showing that ECI-guided generation strictly adheres to physical\nconstraints and accurately captures complex distribution shifts induced by\nthese constraints. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches in various zero-shot constrained\ngeneration tasks and also achieves competitive results in the regression tasks\nwithout additional fine-tuning.",

By\nintroducing a randomized measurement pattern with such bases, a phase\ntransition can be induced by altering the ratio between them. In this work, we\nnumerically investigate a measurement-based model associated with the $(2+1)$d\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fradkin-Shenker Hamiltonian model, encompassing the deconfining,\nconfining, and Higgs phases. We determine the phase diagram in our\nmeasurement-only model by employing entanglement measures. For the bulk\ntopological order, we use the topological entanglement entropy. We also use the\nmutual information between separated boundary regions to diagnose the boundary\nphase transition associated with the Higgs or the bulk SPT phase. We observe\nthe structural similarity between our phase diagram and the one in the standard\nquantum Hamiltonian formulation of the Fradkin-Shenker model with the open\nrough boundary. First, a deconfining phase is detected by nonzero and constant\ntopological entanglement entropy. Second, we find a (boundary) phase transition\ncurve separating the Higgs=SPT phase from the rest. In certain limits, the\ntopological phase transitions reside at the critical point of the formation of\ngiant homological cycles in the bulk 3d spacetime lattice, as well as the bond\npercolation threshold of the boundary 2d spacetime lattice when it is\neffectively decoupled from the bulk. Additionally, there are analogous\nmixed-phase properties at a certain region of the phase diagram, emerging from\nhow we terminate the measurement-based procedure.

First, we experiment with\ngradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this\napproach has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce\nIQA-Adapter, a novel architecture that conditions generation on target quality\nlevels by learning the relationship between images and quality scores. When\nconditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter shifts the distribution of\ngenerated images towards a higher-quality subdomain. This approach achieves up\nto a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a\nsubjective study, while preserving generative diversity and content.\nAdditionally, IQA-Adapter can be used inversely as a degradation model,\ngenerating progressively more distorted images when conditioned on lower\nquality scores.

Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS),\na diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS\nemploys an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project\ndiscrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On\nthese inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models,\nenabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and\npopulation spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately\nrecovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we\ndemonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics\nhuman cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with\nan expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not\nmediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated\nsamples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during\ndiverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach\ndirection or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables\ninference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of\nneural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating\nexperimentally testable hypotheses.",
