            "summary": "Accurate gradient sensing is crucial for efficient chemotaxis in noisy\nenvironments, but the relationship between cell shape deformations and sensing\naccuracy is not well understood. Using a theoretical framework based on maximum\nlikelihood estimation, we show that the receptor dispersion, quantified by cell\nshape convex hull, fundamentally limits gradient sensing accuracy. Cells with a\nconcave shape and isotropic error space achieve optimal performance in gradient\ndetection. This concave shape, resulting from active protrusions or\ncontractions, can significantly improve gradient sensing accuracy at the cost\nof increased energy expenditure. By balancing sensing accuracy and deformation\ncost, we predict that a concave, three-branched shape as optimal for cells in\nshallow gradients. To achieve efficient chemotaxis, our theory suggests that a\ncell should adopt a repeating \"run-and-expansion\" cycle. Our theoretical\npredictions align well with experimental observations, implying that the fast\namoeboid cell motion is optimized near the physical limit for chemotaxis. This\nstudy highlights the crucial role of active cell shape deformation in\nfacilitating accurate chemotaxis.",

A key challenge in\nautomating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched\nstructures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is\ndifficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While\nexisting research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable\nLinear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear\nObjects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs\ncreate complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot\nbe adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched\nElastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework\nthat combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework\nto: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at\njunction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient\ncomputation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate\ndexterous BDLO manipulation.

Given a finite-size system described with a\nspecific instance of this general class of models, we address the question of\nhow to asses if such system is a realization of the AKLT model using inelastic\ntunnel spectroscopy implemented with scanning tunnel microscopy (IETS-STM). We\npropose two approaches. First, in the case of a dimer, we show how to leverage\nnon-equilibrium IETS-STM to obtain the energies of all excited states, and\ndetermine thereby the magnitude of both linear and non-linear exchange\ninteractions. Second, we explore how IETS can probe the in-gap excitations\nassociated to edge spins. In the AKLT limit, spins $S=3/2$ at the edge of the\nlattice have coordination 2, giving rise to $S=1/2$ dangling spins that can be\nprobed with IETS.

            "summary": "We propose a novel meshless method to achieve super-resolution from scattered\ndata obtained from sparse, randomly-positioned sensors such as the particle\ntracers of particle tracking velocimetry. The method combines K-Nearest\nNeighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN-PTV, Tirelli et al. 2023) with\nmeshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al. 2025)\nand constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c-RBFs, Sperotto et al.\n2022). The main idea is to use KNN-PTV to enhance the spatial resolution of\nflow fields by blending data from \\textit{locally similar} flow regions\navailable in the time series. This \\textit{similarity} is assessed in terms of\nstatistical coherency with leading features, identified by meshless POD\ndirectly on the scattered data without the need to first interpolate onto a\ngrid, but instead relying on RBFs to compute all the relevant inner products.\nLastly, the proposed approach uses the c-RBF on the denser scattered\ndistributions to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that\nincorporates physical constraints. This combination is meshless because it does\nnot require the definition of a grid at any step of the calculation, thus\nproviding flexibility in handling complex geometries. The algorithm is\nvalidated on 3D measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment covers three\nkey aspects: statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. The proposed method is\nevaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN-PTV, and c-RBFs. The\nresults demonstrate improved accuracy, with an average error on the order of\n11%, compared to 13-14% for the other methods. Additionally, the proposed\nmethod achieves an increase in the cutoff frequency of approximately 3-4/D,\ncompared to the values observed in the competing approaches.

High-fidelity computational models are\noften employed to simulate plume dynamics, guiding decision-making and\nprioritizing resource deployment. However, such models can be prohibitively\nexpensive to simulate, as they require resolving turbulent flows at fine\nspatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, there are at least two distinct\ndynamical regimes of interest in the plume: (i) the initial ejection of the\nplume where turbulent mixing is generated by the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, and (ii) the ensuing turbulent diffusion and advection which is\noften modeled by the Gaussian plume model. We address the challenge of modeling\nthe initial plume generation. Specifically, we propose a data-driven framework\nthat identifies a reduced-order analytical model for plume dynamics -- directly\nfrom video data. We extract a time series of plume center and edge points from\nvideo snapshots and evaluate different regressions based to their extrapolation\nperformance to generate a time series of coefficients that characterize the\nplume's overall direction and spread. We regress to a sinusoidal model inspired\nby the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the edge points in order to identify\nthe plume's dispersion and vorticity. Overall, this reduced-order modeling\nframework provides a data-driven and lightweight approach to capture the\ndominant features of the initial nonlinear point-source plume dynamics,\nagnostic to plume type and starting only from video.
