In this paper, we introduce ARM4R,\nan Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations\nlearned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model.\nSpecifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from\nvideos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth\nestimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric\nstructure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear\ntransformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to\nlow-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer\nefficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves\nperformance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.",

Magma is a significant extension of\nvision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding\nability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the\nability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal\nintelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot\nmanipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large\namounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics\ndata, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in\nimages are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object\nmovements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are\nlabeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show\nthat SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of\nspatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a\nwide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new\nstate-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks,\noutperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On\nimage and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to\npopular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets.

In this paper, we\nare concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of\nfinite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with\nlarge initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and\nrepulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for\ndimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit\nof the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the\nNavier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing\nviscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It\nis observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no\nconcentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we\nprove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the\nEuler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric\nperturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the\npotential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the\nnonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which\nis a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\\\"onwall type estimate\nis required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in\nthe sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential.\nFurthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions\nfor the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing\nconcentration compactness arguments.
