            "summary": "Recent advancements in behavior cloning have enabled robots to perform\ncomplex manipulation tasks. However, accurately assessing training performance\nremains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior\ncloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently,\nresearchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and\ntime-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal\npolicies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address\nthese issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that\nincorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout\nthe entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and\ndeployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical\nworld, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted\nfrom the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by\nrendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state\ninformation from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies\ncan be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly\nparallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the\nsimulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints,\neffectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating\ntraditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT\nmanipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates\nobtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations.

However, the\nMEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the\nBeryllium transition ${^8}\\text{Be}^\\star\\to{^8}\\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of\nthis result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations\nof the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$\nwith mass around $17\\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of\na spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was\ninitially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous\nsignal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the\nSINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon\nanomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.",

In this work, we introduce a new toolkit for analyzing cloning\ngames; these games capture more quantitative versions of no-cloning and are\ncentral to unclonable cryptography. Previous works rely on the framework laid\nout by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski and Wehner to analyze both the $n$-qubit\nBB84 game and the subspace coset game. Their constructions and analysis face\nthe following inherent limitations:\n  - The existing bounds on the values of these games are at least $2^{-0.25n}$;\non the other hand, the trivial adversarial strategy wins with probability\n$2^{-n}$. Not only that, the BB84 game does in fact admit a highly nontrivial\nwinning strategy. This raises the natural question: are there cloning games\nwhich admit no non-trivial winning strategies?\n  - The existing constructions are not multi-copy secure; the BB84 game is not\neven $2 \\mapsto 3$ secure, and the subspace coset game is not $t \\mapsto t+1$\nsecure for a polynomially large $t$. Moreover, we provide evidence that the\nexisting technical tools do not suffice to prove multi-copy security of even\ncompletely different constructions. This raises the natural question: can we\ndesign new cloning games that achieve multi-copy security, possibly by\ndeveloping a new analytic toolkit?\n  We study a new cloning game based on binary phase states and show that it is\n$t$-copy secure when $t=o(n/\\log n)$. Moreover, for constant $t$, we obtain the\nfirst asymptotically optimal bounds of $O(2^{-n})$. We also show a worst-case\nto average-case reduction for a large class of cloning games, which allows us\nto show the same quantitative results for Haar cloning games. These technical\ningredients together enable two new applications which have previously been out\nof reach; one in black hole physics, and one in unclonable cryptography.",

            "summary": "The rarefied flow and multi-scale flow are crucial for the aerodynamic design\nof spacecraft, ultra-low orbital vehicles and plumes. By introducing a discrete\nvelocity space, the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods can\ncapture complex and non-equilibrium distribution functions and describe flow\nbehaviors exactly. The unified methods predict flows from continuum to rarefied\nregimes by adopting unified modeling, and they can be further applied to other\nmulti-scale physics such as radiation heat transfer, phonon heat transfer and\nplasma. In the flow field, the concrete dynamic process needs to describe the\ngas-gas interaction and gas-surface interaction (GSI). However, in both DVM and\nunified methods, only a simple but not accurate GSI is used, which can be\nregarded as a Maxwell GSI with a fixed accommodation coefficient of 1 (full\naccommodation) at the present stage. To overcome the bottleneck in extending\nDVM and unified methods to the numerical experiment and investigate real\nmulti-scale flow physics, this paper realizes precise GSI in the DVM framework\nby constructing the boundary conditions of a concrete Maxwell GSI with an\nadjustable accommodation coefficient. In the constructing process, the problems\nof macro-conservation and micro-consistency in the DVS at the boundary are well\nsolved by reflected macroscopic flux and interpolation distribution function\nand interpolation error correction, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that\nthe multi-scale flows in the background of aeronautics and aerospace are often\nat supersonic and hypersonic speeds, the unstructured velocity space (UVS) is\nessential. From the perspective of generality, the GSI is forced on UVS.\nBesides, by combined with the unified method (the unified gas-kinetic scheme in\nthe paper), the effectiveness and validity of the present GSI on the DVM\nframework are verified by a series of simulations.",

In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar\nfield based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the\nvacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but\nresults in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part.\nOur elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive\nscalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known\ntwo-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one.\nRemarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field\ncoincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear\nphysical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the\nSchwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach,\nand the Hartree-Fock approximation.

Existing diffusion models for SR have relied\npredominantly on Gaussian models for noise generation, which often fall short\nwhen dealing with the complex and variable texture inherent in natural scenes.\nTo address these deficiencies, we introduce the Bayesian Uncertainty Guided\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model (BUFF). BUFF distinguishes itself by\nincorporating a Bayesian network to generate high-resolution uncertainty masks.\nThese masks guide the diffusion process, allowing for the adjustment of noise\nintensity in a manner that is both context-aware and adaptive. This novel\napproach not only enhances the fidelity of super-resolved images to their\noriginal high-resolution counterparts but also significantly mitigates\nartifacts and blurring in areas characterized by complex textures and fine\ndetails. The model demonstrates exceptional robustness against complex noise\npatterns and showcases superior adaptability in handling textures and edges\nwithin images. Empirical evidence, supported by visual results, illustrates the\nmodel's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios, and its effectiveness\nin addressing common SR issues such as blurring. Experimental evaluations\nconducted on the DIV2K dataset reveal that BUFF achieves a notable improvement,\nwith a +0.61 increase compared to baseline in SSIM on BSD100, surpassing\ntraditional diffusion approaches by an average additional +0.20dB PSNR gain.\nThese findings underscore the potential of Bayesian methods in enhancing\ndiffusion processes for SR, paving the way for future advancements in the\nfield.",

Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by\nintervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting\ndistributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a\nsource vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap,\nthese fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not\naccounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions\nthat cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work\nlinear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a\nglobal loss that accounts simultaneously for all layerwise distributional\nshifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be\nregularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron\nand layer selection. Empirically, LinEAS only requires a handful of samples to\nbe effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation, while\nperforming on par with far more involved finetuning approaches.
