Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and\nIdeogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have\ndemonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising\nquestions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose\napplicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit\ncapabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image\nediting, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision\ntasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current\nevaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models'\nperformance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we\ndeveloped the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0,\nMidjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided\ninto five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical\nconsistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and\nmulti-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each\nmodel's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of\nFLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring\nthe expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI\ntools. This study provides valuable insights into the current state and future\ntrajectory of T2I models as they evolve towards general-purpose usability.\nEvaluation scripts will be released at https://github.com/jylei16/Imagine-e.",

            "summary": "Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong-Ou-Mandel\neffect to Bose-Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental\nscience to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on\neffective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their\ninfinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple\nclass of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are\nused to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural\nbosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum\neffects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional\nspaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic\nsystems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to\ncapture real effects?\n  Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum\ntechnologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective\ndescriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our\ntechnical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic\nunitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary\nevolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can\nbe generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical\noperators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications\nfor classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide\nuniversal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they\nshow that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum\ncomputing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional\nSolovay--Kitaev theorem.",

The DP can modify Maxwell's equations, due to its\nkinetic mixing with regular photon, inducing an oscillating component in the\nelectromagnetic field. This may leave an imprint in polarimetric light signals,\ncharacterised by a distinctive wave pattern in spacetime. As a demonstration,\nwe apply this methodology to investigate ultralight DP produced through the\nsuperradiance of supermassive black holes. Then using the polarimetric\nmeasurements of the radiation from M87$^\\ast$ at the Event Horizon Telescope,\nwe show that all Stokes parameters can serve as a probe in conducting this\ntask. Especially, the absence of significant temporal variation in the\nlinear-polarisation position angle of the M87$^\\ast$ images allows us to set\nnovel limits on the photon-DP mixing parameter over the rarely-explored DP mass\nrange of $10^{-22}$--$10^{-20}$eV, with the best reach of $\\sim 10^{-8}$\nachieved at $\\sim 10^{-20.2}$eV.

It would be due\nto the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is\ndescribed by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital\nprecessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object,\ncalculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully\nreproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\\ast$. In\nparticular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of\nthe accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular\norbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring\nprecessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\\pm\n0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically\nmeaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the\neffective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii.\nRelying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the\nangle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the\nyears amounting to $1.16^\\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of\n$1.25^\\circ\\pm 0.18^\\circ$.

            "summary": "The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints\nin the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational\ninfluence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one\nsecond after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe.\nThis induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique\nsignature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these\nrelativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of\nparticle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to\nrobustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and\npolarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these\nspectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase\nshift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying\nthese methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at\nabout $10\\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\\sigma$ with\nadditional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole\nTelescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model\nprediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the\ncapabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise\nphase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the\n$1\\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally,\nwe establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos\nand other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues\nfor exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and\nmodel-agnostic way.",

However, the training of\nconsistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF\nODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more\nchallenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only\nconcerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this\ntraining paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency\nmodels. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the\ntruncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at\nearlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new\nparameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure\nthat prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial\nsolution.

However, the non-stationary nature of mobile\ntraffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both\nregular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing\nsuch complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent\nuncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising\nnetworks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially\nleading to sub-optimal performance.
