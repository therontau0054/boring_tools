We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics,\nmathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We\nintroduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs\nto solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem\ndescriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\\circledR$, an FEA software, to\ncompute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped\nwith the ability to interact with the software through its Application\nProgramming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its\nsolutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates\nexecutable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with\nand operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would\npush the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability\nwould augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers\nand advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex\nproblems in the real world.

With applied drive, we observe\nmultiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and\nin-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise\nfrom a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the\nsuperconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our\nnumerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width\nto coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization.\nThis work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing\nvoltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and\nprovides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet\neffects.",

We compute one-loop beta functions.\nDepending on the sign of the beta function, backreaction may either cause a\nminor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature of the\nstate. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the\nepsilon expansion and IR fixed points, with epsilon now set by the scaling of\nthe interaction rather than the spacetime dimension. In the language of RG\nflow, critical-balance scaling -- which has applications in fields as varied as\nastrophysics and ocean waves -- corresponds to the state dynamically adjusting\nitself along the RG flow until the interaction becomes marginal.",

However, recent studies have shown that\ndiffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to\nenter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate\ntheir desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on\ntarget noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor\nattacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks\noften rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image,\nlacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel backdoor attack method called \"Parasite\" for image-to-image\ntasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage\nsteganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the\ntarget content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack.\n\"Parasite\" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection\nframeworks to execute backdoor attacks.
