Decay of the excitation itself is a\nfundamental error channel that is difficult to overcome via external drive or\ncontrol techniques. Quantum error correcting codes, which encode information in\nsuperpositions involving multiple excitations, provide a path to preserve\ninformation beyond the capacity of individual excitations, but typically\nrequire exquisite active operations on the system. Here, we demonstrate a\nsteady-state driven dissipative quantum system, composed of a superconducting\ncavity and a transmon ancilla, that preserves a logical qubit beyond the\nphoton-lifetime limit by about 5% using a binomial encoding. This realization\nof continuous quantum error correction at the breakeven point highlights the\nquantitative competitiveness of passive correction strategies while\ncircumventing some demanding hardware requirements of its active counterparts.",

However, they often struggle with\ncapturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually\noccurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long\nrollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step\nprediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling\nDiffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that\nintegrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI),\na parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based\nrefinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a\ntemporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic\nmultigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh\nresolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message\nPassing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural\neffects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We\nvalidate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving\ngeometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.

One of the strengths of our approach is being\nself-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to\niteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor,\nwhich uses a set of physical descriptors as input.
