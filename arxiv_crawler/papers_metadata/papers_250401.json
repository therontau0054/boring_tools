            "summary": "The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury\nBrown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation\nof quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental\nprocesses such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into\nalready occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of\nlight scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\\rm\nf}$, where $N_{\\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.\nHere, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a\nquasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak\ninteractions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have\na dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)\nbeyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can\ncompletely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive\nones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly\ntuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of\nmagnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme\nsensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light\nscattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic\ngases.",

Phase and group velocities are derived and several interesting\nbehaviors are unveiled, such as birefringence, non-reciprocal propagation, and\nasymmetries between phase and group velocities in special configurations.\nSpecific solutions based on commonly studied nonlinear theories are also\ninvestigated, and phenomena like slow-light and one-way propagation are\ndiscussed.",

The structures of\namorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline\npolymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such\nstructural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or\ncomputationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining\nexperimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic\npotentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate\nframework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear\ndifferences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous\ntetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption\nthat these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this\nend, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous\nsolids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in\ncrystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into\nthe structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new\navenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more\ngenerally.",

The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric\neffects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry\nof the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction.\nRecently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that\nemerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced\napplications.

In parallel to ordinary\nsuperconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been\nexplored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers\nhas been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials,\nincluding Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally\nbiased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in\nrecent times.

Since century-old established theories are traditionally\nimpossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining\nantimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the\nexistence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable\nAntimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a\nframework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists,\nand thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy.

            "summary": "The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a\ngradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the\noutput towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural\nnetworks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below,\nthis approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features\nlive on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are\nexpected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning\nmethod named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards\npropagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching\nmethods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We\nbelieve this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of\ngradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical\nrepresentations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the\nrepresentation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target,\nlearning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\nimage classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable\nlearning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and\ncomputationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free\nmethods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm,\nNoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more\nefficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other\ncharacteristics of the learning process.",

            "summary": "The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding\nthe physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects.\nHowever, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler\nImager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the\nability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these\nolder datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles,\nenabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic\nnetwork dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach\nfor Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the\nhigher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).\nBy training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI\ndata and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution\nof MDI observations from 2\"/pixel to 0.5\"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the\nreconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and\nLPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux\nor the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with\ndifferent variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models\n(DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past\nfor performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis\nin the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller\nthan 2\", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their\nreliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to\nsuper-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can\nalso have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.",

            "summary": "Objects produce different sounds when hit, and humans can intuitively infer\nhow an object might sound based on its appearance and material properties.\nInspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that\nbridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and\nsound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional\ndiffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a\nfeature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the\nsound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the\nfeature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound\nsources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for\ncollecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between\ncaptured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in\na 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds\nand accurately localizing impact sources.

            "summary": "Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are\nlong-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging\nevent-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond\ntemporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in\neither restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this\npaper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion\ndeblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event\nstreams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we\nintroduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral,\nachieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we\npropose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the\nedge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and\nreal-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing\nsignificantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.\nOur project page is https://diet-gs.github.io",

            "summary": "The stock market, as a cornerstone of the financial markets, places\nforecasting stock price movements at the forefront of challenges in\nquantitative finance. Emerging learning-based approaches have made significant\nprogress in capturing the intricate and ever-evolving data patterns of modern\nmarkets. With the rapid expansion of the stock market, it presents two\ncharacteristics, i.e., stock exogeneity and volatility heterogeneity, that\nheighten the complexity of price forecasting. Specifically, while stock\nexogeneity reflects the influence of external market factors on price\nmovements, volatility heterogeneity showcases the varying difficulty in\nmovement forecasting against price fluctuations. In this work, we introduce the\nframework of Cross-market Synergy with Pseudo-volatility Optimization (CSPO).\nSpecifically, CSPO implements an effective deep neural architecture to leverage\nexternal futures knowledge. This enriches stock embeddings with cross-market\ninsights and thus enhances the CSPO's predictive capability. Furthermore, CSPO\nincorporates pseudo-volatility to model stock-specific forecasting confidence,\nenabling a dynamic adaptation of its optimization process to improve accuracy\nand robustness. Our extensive experiments, encompassing industrial evaluation\nand public benchmarking, highlight CSPO's superior performance over existing\nmethods and effectiveness of all proposed modules contained therein.",
