However, despite the availability of\nadvanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains\nlimited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this\ngap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of\nhierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot\nhealthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the\nsystem's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination\nfailures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure\nreports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,\nusing AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure\nand further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models\noperating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical\nfindings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the\nimportance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for\nfuture real-world deployment.

However, quantum mechanics permits events to occur in a superposition of\ncausal orders, providing new types of quantum resources for quantum information\ntasks. Previous demonstrations of indefinite causal order have relied on a\nprocess known as quantum switch and depended on specific assumptions about the\ndevices used in the laboratory. Recently, a theoretical scheme for the\ncertification of indefinite causal order in the quantum switch has been\nobtained solely from the output statistics of the devices, analogous to the\ndevice-independent proofs of nonlocality through violations of the Bell\ninequality. Here, we report an experimental verification of the causal\ninequality using spacelike-separated entangled photons, where one photon\nfunctions as the control qubit in a quantum switch and the other serves as an\nadditional observer. Through local measurement statistics, we observe a\nviolation of the causal inequality by 24 standard deviations. This work\nprovides evidence for a device-independent certification of indefinite causal\norder, relying solely on observed correlations without requiring device\ncharacterization.

Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential\nfor efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training\nstrategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one\ndimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The\ntwo-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within\nthe experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from\nsteel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based\nquality control in industrial applications.",

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.
