            "summary": "Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in\nopen-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific\nsupervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic\nreasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a\ncompelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However,\ntheir outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether\nimagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap\nbetween imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),\nan agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration\nis often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to\ndeepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to\nabstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,\npredict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences\nthrough action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop\nenvironments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful\nexploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the\nentropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports\ndownstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the\nperformance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.",

At the same\ntime, both ATLAS and CMS as well as all experiments at the Large\nElectron-Position (LEP) collider have reported excesses consistent with a light\nHiggs boson channel around 95 GeV, suggesting a potential connection between\nthese two signals. In this study, we investigate these anomalies within the\ncontext of the CP-conserving 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type~III. In our\nproposed scenario, a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ with a mass near 650 GeV\ndecays into a SM-like Higgs boson $H$ and a $Z$ boson, with the $H$ boson\nsubsequently decaying into diphotons and the $Z$ boson decaying into $b\\bar{b}$\npairs. To explain the excess around 95 GeV, we independently select the mass of\nthe light CP-even Higgs boson of the model $h$ to be around this value. This\nconfiguration allows for a consistent explanation of both the high- and\nlow-mass excesses observed in the experiments. Through a detailed analysis, we\ndemonstrate that these two signals can be fitted simultaneously at the\n2.5$\\sigma$ significance level, offering a promising solution to the observed\nanomalies and potentially hinting at new physics Beyond the Standard Model\n(BSM).",

This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected\nensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has\nbeen shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on\nsymmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in\nquantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated\nby solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the\nlimiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the\nsize of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that\nthey correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the\nliterature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states\ncomposing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum\ninformation between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper\nbounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp\ntransition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of\nthat the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate\nthe first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which\nare relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein\nmeasurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and\nnatural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.",

While\nthe set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands\nseparately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack\nof Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose\nHall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical\nand analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional\nquantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as\npossible explanations.

In optimization theory, a\nsemi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over\nthe cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space.\nThese problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization\ncommunities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are\nessentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by\nquantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the\naforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant\nsolution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is\nconcave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard\n(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these\nparameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low\ntemperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for\nthe minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent\napproach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it\ncan be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the\nalgorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum\nthermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why\nalgorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the\nmatrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient\nupdate method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at\nsolving SDPs.",

The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the\nrelevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its\natomic origins.
