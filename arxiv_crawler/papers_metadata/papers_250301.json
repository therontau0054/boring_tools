Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human\ndemonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the\npipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic\nretargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot\nembodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically\nconsistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the\npotential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware\nconfigurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness\nby training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging\ncontact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a\nfloating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are\ndeployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success\nrates with minimal human input. Project website:\nhttps://lujieyang.github.io/physicsgen/.",

Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses\nhandling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are\nthe building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a\nvariational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a\nubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor\nnetwork methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum\ncorrelations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert\nspace as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain\nspeedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional\nfactor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.",

            "summary": "Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial\ntissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis,\ninflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart\nimposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a\npersistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan\ndurations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data,\nand recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with\nthe reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most\ncurrent T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not\nexploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we\nintroduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1\nsignal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the\nlearning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay\nestimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT\nsignificantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned\nsingle-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving\nhigher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we\nobserve consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along\nwith marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our\nresults highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the\nphysical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and\nreduced acquisition times.

Specifically, we consider a JJ\nwith a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling\nintroduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be\nnaturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar\nproblems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for\nderiving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we\ncompute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of\napplicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot\ndensity of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in\ndifferent transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH\ndescription is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound\nstates (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS\nenergies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their\nline-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but\nalso offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.",

            "summary": "There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in\nthe next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is\nthe absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to\nthis situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear\ndifferential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is\nable to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the\nglobal population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years\nuntil now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst)\nplateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth\nregimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various\nlimits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population\ndynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In\nparticular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which\nassumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the\npast decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the\nresource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden\nrise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as\n2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in\ntoday, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates\nof the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce\nby half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new\naggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so\nas to avoid the doomsday scenarios.",

A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the\nimage, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This\nprocess has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability,\nlimiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones.\nRecognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition,\nthis work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a\ncondition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the\ninversion quality.

This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's\noutput and enhances both reconstruction and editability.

Previous machine learning methods have focused on identifying\ninfections by analyzing wound images alone, without utilizing additional\nmetadata such as medical notes. In this study, we aim to improve infection\ndetection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound\nInfection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages\nsynthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two\ncomponents: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on\nGPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images;\nand (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract\ncross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption.\nInfection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a\nlabeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a\nlatent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result,\nSCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity,\nspecificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound\ninfection classification. Displaying the generated captions alongside the wound\nimages and infection detection results enhances interpretability and trust,\nenabling nurses to align SCARWID outputs with their medical knowledge.
