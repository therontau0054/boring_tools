            "summary": "One of the most challenging problems in quantum physics is to quantify the\nentanglement of $d$-partite states and their separability. We show here that\nthese problems are best addressed using tensors. The geometric measure of\nentanglement of a pure state is one of most natural ways to quantify the\nentanglement, which is simply related to the spectral norm of a tensor state.\nOn the other hand, the logarithm of the nuclear norm of the state and density\ntensors can be considered as its ``energy''. We first show that the most\ngeometric measure entangled $d$-partite state has the minimum spectral norm and\nmaximum nuclear norm. Second, we introduce the notion of Hermitian and density\ntensors, and the subspace of bi-symmetric Hermitian tensors, which correspond\nto Bosons. We show that separable density tensors, and strongly separable\nbi-symmetric density tensors are characterized by the value (equal to one) of\ntheir corresponding nuclear norms. In general, these characterizations are\nNP-hard to verify. Third, we show that the above quantities are computed in\npolynomial time when we restrict our attentions to Bosons: symmetric\n$d$-qubits, or more generally to symmetric $d$-qunits in $C^n$, and the\ncorresponding bi-symmetric Hermtian density tensors, for a fixed value of $n$.",

            "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as\nevidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized\ncontributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks\nsemantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With\nthe purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the\nworld, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of\ntranslating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we\nargue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a\nneurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the\nneural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic\nAI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are\nsatisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction\napproaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a\nframework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural\nnetworks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various\nexisting approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how\nlogical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we\nreview some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for\nneural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our\nframework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic\nencoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.",

The hidden state\nis the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC in an exponentially large Hilbert\nspace $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$, which serves as a coherent recurrent quantum memory.\nThe PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution\nnorm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit\nPauli expectation-value readouts are combined with the input embedding and\nprocessed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state\nvia unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it\nunifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial\nobservation via mid-circuit readouts, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for\ninput-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up\nto 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and\nlanguage modeling. For sequence-to-sequence learning, we further devise a soft\nattention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts and show its effectiveness\nfor machine translation.

Unlike linear Thouless pumping, which requires excitation of a\nWannier function of a uniformly filled band, quantized soliton pumping is\nobserved even with localized excitations that do not represent Wannier\nfunctions. Here, we show that similar soliton-like quantized pumping can be\nobserved in Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model by introducing a synthetic\nnonlinearity in the form of a cutoff on the coupling strengths between lattice\nsites. More importantly, we reveal that the localized excitations driving\nquantized soliton pumping are precisely the Wannier functions of the uniformly\nfilled bands of the effectively nonlinear lattice, thus restoring consistency\nwith linear Thouless pumping. We extend this approach to multi-band systems and\nshow that the nonlinearity introduces a degeneracy between bands, subsequently\nleading to the observation of fractionally quantized pumping. Our approach of\nintroducing a synthetic nonlinearity is general and could be extended to reveal\nsoliton dynamics in other nonlinear topological systems.",

This can leave the misleading impression of the Sun as a bright ball\nin a dark void, rather than revealing it as the dynamic, structured source of\nthe solar wind and space weather. A variety of enhancement algorithms have been\ndeveloped to address this challenge, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs.\nWe introduce the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF), a novel hybrid\ntechnique that optimizes contrast in high dynamic range solar images. By\ncombining the spatial awareness of radial graded filters with the perceptual\nbenefits of histogram equalization, RHEF reveals faint coronal structures and\nworks out of the box -- without requiring careful parameter tuning or prior\ndataset characterization. RHEF operates independently on each frame, and it\nenhances on-disk and off-limb features uniformly across the field of view. For\nadditional control, we also present the Upsilon redistribution function -- a\nsymmetrized cousin of gamma correction -- as an optional post-processing step\nthat provides intuitive programmatic tonal compression. We benchmark RHEF\nagainst established methods and offer guidance on filter selection across\nvarious applications, with examples from multiple solar instruments provided in\nan appendix.

Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of\nwhen the Minkowski sum of alcoved simplices is again alcoved via a graphical\ncriterion on pairs of ordered set partitions. Our characterization reduces to\nchecking conditions on restricted partitions of length at most six. In\nparticular, we show how the Minkowski sum decompositions of the two most\nwell-known families of alcoved polytopes, the associahedron and the\ncyclohedron, fit in our framework.
