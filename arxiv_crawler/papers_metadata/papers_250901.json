            "summary": "Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter\nthrough the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode\ninformation. However, copying an extended molecule requires highly processive\ncopying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid\nthe error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an\nalternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical\nmolecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded\nand transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using\na model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly\nanneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed\nrelative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and\ntheory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by\ncompetition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can\nbe propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even if the mutation rate\nis above the error catastrophe for a physically intact genome.",

            "summary": "Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime\ntargets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate\nactuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes\nassume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making\nthem vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We\nclose this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models\ndynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive\npolicy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian\nwatermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing\nsystem knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control\nperformance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We\ndevelop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence\nin linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,\nunderpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D\ncontroller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by\n70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance\nbaselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one\nsampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,\nrapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding\nexisting benchmarks.",

Phenomenological models inspired by Quantum Chromodynamics used for\nthese phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase\nspace. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable\nexperimental data. Until now, event generators have primarily been developed\nand tuned based on data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators.\nHowever, in many cases they have been found to not satisfactorily describe data\nfrom astroparticle experiments, which provide sensitivity especially to hadrons\nproduced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass\nenergies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so\nfar.
