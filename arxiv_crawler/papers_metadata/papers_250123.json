            "summary": "We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial\nvector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic\nscattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the\npseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case,\nwe show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical\nPVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral\ncondensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the\nmassless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a\nprimordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\\bar \\eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten\ncoupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical\n$\\eta^\\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by\n$O(10\\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic\nexpression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that\nthe proton's net quark helicity $\\Delta \\Sigma\\propto \\sqrt{\\chi_{\\rm QCD}'\n|_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral\nlimit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction\nthat the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like\ntopological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our\nresults illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in\nsynergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can\nuncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.",

However, current THz imaging systems encounter substantial\nchallenges owing to hardware limitations, which result in information loss and\nrestricted imaging throughput during data digitization and information\nextraction processes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid\ncompressive optical-digital neural network designed to facilitate both\nreal-time THz imaging and precise object information extraction. This approach\nutilizes a physical encoder, an optical neural network (ONN), to transform and\nreduce the dimensionality of physical signals, effectively compressing them to\nfit the physical constraints of THz sensor arrays. After the compressed signals\nare captured and digitized by the THz sensor array, a jointly trained digital\nneural network (DNN) reconstructs the signals into their desired or original\nform. Our proposed THz ONN-DNN computational imaging system demonstrates\nenhanced imaging quality, an expanded field of view with a lens-free system,\ndiffraction-free imaging capability, and real-time THz video capture at a rate\nof two frames per second.",

However, these models\nare typically trained for one specific task, e.g., a separate model for each of\ncolor, depth, and normal prediction. Such models do not leverage the intrinsic\ncorrelation between appearance and geometry, often leading to inconsistent\npredictions.\n  In this paper, we propose using a novel image diffusion prior that jointly\nencodes appearance and geometry.

Orchid directly generates photo-realistic color images,\nrelative depth, and surface normals from user-provided text, and can be used to\ncreate image-aligned partial 3D scenes seamlessly.

            "summary": "As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, and their\nperformance is driven by training data, appraising the contribution of data\ncontributors is crucial to creating incentives for sharing quality data and to\nimplementing policies for data compensation. Depending on the use case, model\nperformance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution\nlearned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we\naddress the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to\ndata contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to\nvaluation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However,\nestimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical\nbecause it requires retraining on many training data subsets corresponding to\ndifferent contributors and rerunning inference. We introduce a method to\nefficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by\nleveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method\nwith three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset,\n(ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic\nquality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist\nartworks. Our results empirically demonstrate that our framework can identify\nimportant data contributors across models' global properties, outperforming\nexisting attribution methods for diffusion models.",

            "summary": "Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse\na diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise,\nhave achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their\nsuperior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often\nconstrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this\npaper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal\nassumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of\nthe score functions, the total variation distance between the target and\ngenerated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic\nfactors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps.\nThis result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment.\nMoreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate\nimproves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data\ndistribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to\nunknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image\ndistributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical\ntools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates\nat each step of the reverse process.",

            "summary": "This paper investigates how diffusion generative models leverage (unknown)\nlow-dimensional structure to accelerate sampling. Focusing on two mainstream\nsamplers -- the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and the denoising\ndiffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) -- and assuming accurate score estimates,\nwe prove that their iteration complexities are no greater than the order of\n$k/\\varepsilon$ (up to some log factor), where $\\varepsilon$ is the precision\nin total variation distance and $k$ is some intrinsic dimension of the target\ndistribution. Our results are applicable to a broad family of target\ndistributions without requiring smoothness or log-concavity assumptions.\nFurther, we develop a lower bound that suggests the (near) necessity of the\ncoefficients introduced by Ho et al.(2020) and Song et al.(2020) in\nfacilitating low-dimensional adaptation. Our findings provide the first\nrigorous evidence for the adaptivity of the DDIM-type samplers to unknown\nlow-dimensional structure, and improve over the state-of-the-art DDPM theory\nregarding total variation convergence.",

            "summary": "Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in\nquantitative finance. Fourier methods leverage the regularity properties of the\nintegrand in the Fourier domain to accurately and rapidly value options that\ntypically lack regularity in the physical domain. However, most of the existing\nFourier approaches face hurdles in high-dimensional settings due to the tensor\nproduct (TP) structure of the commonly employed numerical quadrature\ntechniques. To overcome this difficulty, this work advocates using the\nrandomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier\nmethods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness\nof the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing\npractical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the\nunbounded domain, $\\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to\n$[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at\nthe corners of the hypercube, and hence deteriorate the performance of RQMC. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation\nprocedure based on boundary growth conditions on the transformed integrand. The\nproposed transformation preserves sufficient regularity of the original\nintegrand for fast convergence of the RQMC method. To validate our analysis, we\ndemonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation\nto evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs,\nand dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying\nRQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain\nfor options with up to 15 assets.",
