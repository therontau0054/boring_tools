            "summary": "Many analyses in high-energy physics rely on selection thresholds (cuts)\napplied to detector, particle, or event properties. Initial cut values can\noften be guessed from physical intuition, but cut optimization, especially for\nmultiple features, is commonly performed by hand, or skipped entirely in favor\nof multivariate algorithms like BDTs or classification networks. We revisit\nthis problem, and develop a cut optimization approach based on gradient\ndescent. Cut thresholds are learned as parameters of a network with a simple\narchitecture, and can be tuned to achieve a target signal efficiency through\nthe use of custom loss functions. Contractive terms in the loss can be used to\nensure a smooth evolution of cuts as functions of efficiency, particle\nkinematics, or event features. The method is used to classify events in a\nsearch for Supersymmetry, and the performance is compared with traditional\nclassification networks. An implementation of this approach is available in a\npublic code repository and python package.",

Optimizers that normally would be\ncomputationally out-of-reach (e.g., due to expensive matrix inversions) on\ndigital hardware could be unlocked with physics-based hardware. In this work,\nwe propose a scalable algorithm for employing thermodynamic computers to\naccelerate a popular second-order optimizer called Kronecker-factored\napproximate curvature (K-FAC). Our asymptotic complexity analysis predicts\nincreasing advantage with our algorithm as $n$, the number of neurons per\nlayer, increases. Numerical experiments show that even under significant\nquantization noise, the benefits of second-order optimization can be preserved.\nFinally, we predict substantial speedups for large-scale vision and graph\nproblems based on realistic hardware characteristics.",

Then, we compute the waveforms produced by the plunging particle and\nstudy their spectral content. This allows us to highlight and interpret\nimportant phenomena in the plunge regime, including (i) the excitation of\nquasibound states, with particular emphasis on the amplification and slow decay\nof the post-ringdown phase of the even-parity dipolar mode due to harmonic\nresonance; (ii) during the adiabatic phase, the waveform emitted by the\nplunging particle is very well described by the waveform emitted by the\nparticle living on the innermost stable circular orbit, and (iii) the\nregularized waveforms and their unregularized counterparts constructed from the\nquasinormal mode spectrum are in excellent agreement. Finally, we construct,\nfor arbitrary directions of observation and, in particular, outside the orbital\nplane of the plunging particle, the regularized multipolar waveforms, i.e., the\nwaveforms constructed by summing over partial waveforms.",

Such a\nforce results from the kinetic pressure of the gas occluded by the current\nsheath.\n  The internal energy gained by the gas towards the end of the discharge\ndepends on the full history of the dynamical variables of the system. In other\nterms, the internal energy is a functional of the dynamical variables of the\nsystem.

This study\nexplores the effectiveness of conceptual problem-solving in learning complex\ntopics like general relativity (GR) through a pedagogical framework that\nemphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. Our\ninvestigation, conducted at the University of Cagliari, assessed how students\nstructure their problem framing and its impact on their conceptual learning of\nGR. Results indicate that students who blend conceptual understanding with\nmathematical formalism show a deeper grasp of physical principles and improved\nproblem-solving skills. The research highlights the importance of symbol sense\nand the cyclical nature of problem framing, suggesting that a more integrated\napproach, incorporating visual, symbolic, and natural language elements, could\nenhance students' conceptual understanding.

Here we show that SPADE yields sub-diffraction resolution in the\nbroader context of image classification. To achieve this goal, we outline a\nhybrid machine learning algorithm for image classification that includes a\nphysical part and a computational part. The physical part implements a physical\npre-processing of the optical field that cannot be simulated without\nessentially reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. In detail, a spatial-mode\ndemultiplexer is used to sort the transverse field, followed by mode-wise\nphoton detection. In the computational part, the collected data are fed into an\nartificial neural network for training and classification. As a case study, we\nclassify images from the MNIST dataset after severe blurring due to\ndiffraction.

Although prior work has improved upon the original\nvariance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches\n$\\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it.\nIn this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio\ndisentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled\nindependently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where\nthe TV explodes exponentially, can be $\\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant\nTV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing\nthe SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves\nthe performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step\ngeneration of stable molecules.

However, despite significant advancements in AI, current\nmethods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific\nindividualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing\nlongitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel\nspatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression\nin 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates\nin a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by\nhigh-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata\nto enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior\nknowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the\nintegration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average\nStabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in\nthe predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a\nmeasure of the uncertainty for the prediction. We train and evaluate BrLP on\n11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its\ngeneralizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962\nsubjects.
